# Closing a release: the documentation pass

Docs rot one release at a time and nothing goes red about it. 1.3.0 shipped with roughly
thirty-four files describing an eight-tab Settings panel that had become nine, three manual
screenshots of the old panel, and a CHANGELOG crediting `(#2, #8)` as fixed while both were open.
All three were found by hand, after the fact.

The mechanism to catch most of it already existed and was wired to nothing:
`scripts/gen-wiki.mjs` had thrown on every invocation since 2026-08-09 and three releases shipped
over the top of it, because no job and no step ever ran it.

So this step is one command plus a short list of things only a person can do.

## 1. Order — this runs LAST, and the order is not cosmetic

Run it **after** the release is live: GitHub Release published, `publish.yml` finished, site
`version.json` bumped, SF FRS folder populated. Not before. Two reasons:

- the checks read the RELEASED version out of `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and compare doc prose
  against it, so running early compares against a version nobody has;
- the fixes it produces are ordinary doc commits, and a doc commit pushed to `main` mid-release
  moves the tree the release was cut from.

Everything upstream of this is the release runbook (maintainer-side, machine-local). That runbook
is where the release lives; this is only its last step.

## 2. The command

```
node scripts/release-docs.mjs
```

Read-only: it writes nothing, stages nothing, and every git call it makes is a query. It is safe
in the shared checkout while other agents are working.

`--version X.Y.Z` overrides the version it reads. `--no-tests` skips the vitest doc gates when CI
has just run them on this exact commit.

`--push-gate` runs only the three checks that are true of every commit — screenshot mapping,
manual assets, internal links and anchors. No network, no `gh`, no git history. **CI runs that
subset on every push**, in the `ui` job beside the two `--check` generators, so those three are
already green by the time you get here; a release run is where the other checks live. Nothing
runs the full script but you.

## 3. Reading the report

**FAIL** — mechanically wrong, exits 1, fix before calling the release closed.

| Failure | What to do |
|---|---|
| `gen-settings-reference.mjs --check` | Re-run it without `--check`, then read the RENAMED / NEW / ORPHAN / STALE lists it prints. It moves prose across renames; it never writes a sentence. |
| `gen-wiki.mjs --check` | Either the three derived wiki pages are behind their `docs/` source (re-run it) or a required replacement stopped matching (fix the rule in the script — do NOT ship the page without the transform). |
| the vitest doc gates | `npm --prefix ui exec -- vitest run src/docs-match-code.test.ts src/docs-settings-pointers.test.ts`. The code is the arbiter: the doc is what changes. |
| `docs/RELEASE_NOTES-<ver>.md` missing | Write it. Without it the update feed's `notes` degrades to the GitHub release body. |
| CHANGELOG issue credits | An issue cited as fixed is still open and its bullet claims no NEEDS-BENCH. **A released section is immutable history** — correct it in the next version's section, not by editing the shipped one, and never close the issue to make the check green. A cited number that is neither an issue nor a discussion is a typo; fix it in the next section. |
| screenshot mapping | An image in `docs/img/manual/` matches no family in `SHOT_OWNERS`, or a family names a source file that is gone. Keys are **family prefixes**, longest match wins — a new capture in an existing family needs no edit at all. A non-`.webp` file here is a raw capture somebody committed; run `scripts/build-manual-images.py`. |
| manual assets | A page points at an image that is not there, an image is published but on no page, an alt text is empty or a placeholder, or two names hold identical bytes. All mechanical. Alt text describes the picture for somebody who cannot see it — not a caption, not a repeat of the sentence above it. |
| internal links and anchors | A local link or a heading anchor does not resolve. Usually a heading was reworded in an editing pass. Fix the link or restore the heading; deleting the cross-reference is not the fix. |
| site manual vs `docs/guide` | A chapter is in the repo and 404s on the live site. This is a **deploy**, not a repo edit — see §4. |

**REVIEW** — a human decides, exits 0, printed last so it is the final thing on screen. It does
not fail the run on purpose: a check that is red every single release is a check that gets
switched off, and the FAILs go with it.

- *screenshots older than the UI they show* — ranked by how many commits landed on the source
  since the capture. Work down the list, not across. A source change is not proof the frame
  changed, so open the image first. Re-shoot at a **1920×1080 logical** window (the app's auto-zoom
  resolves to exactly 100% there, so type renders un-shrunk), run `scripts/build-manual-images.py`,
  and **reword the alt text** — it describes the picture, so a new picture under the old sentence
  is a new lie. The 1.3.0 settings captures were ten days and three releases stale.
- *older versions named in prose* — grouped by the sentence, because one editorial decision gets
  pasted into several pages. Some are correct history ("1.0.0 installs over 0.27.0"); some are a
  banner that stopped being news three releases ago.
- *issues credited but still open on purpose* — a fix that shipped under the project's
  **NEEDS-BENCH** flag, where the hardware to prove it on is not here (1.10.3 had two: #126 wants
  an FTDX-101D, #233 a Mac). No repo edit closes these, so they are REVIEW rather than a FAIL
  nobody can act on. Check the flag still belongs before skipping past it — it is published to
  the operator in the release notes, so a false one is a public claim.

## 4. By hand — nothing in the repo can reach these

**The SourceForge wiki does NOT sync from `docs/launch/wiki/*.md`.** Those files are the source;
the wiki is a separate copy that stays stale until someone pastes into it. It is a CodeMirror
editor, so `textarea.value` is clobbered on submit — set
`document.querySelector('.CodeMirror').CodeMirror.setValue(<text>)` and Save. The Allura bearer
token does REST; the SSH key does git and FRS; they are not interchangeable.

The **GitHub wiki** is the same paste from the same source — the three generated pages plus the
four hand-written ones (`Home`, `Rig-Setup`, `_ProjectSummary`, `Documentation`, which have no
`docs/` source and must never be generated over).

The **site's copy of the manual** needs the site checkout, which exists only on the maintainer
machine; CI cannot do it. Deploy, then **curl the live URL** — `wrangler pages deploy` can exit 0
having deployed nothing.

The **SourceForge Default Download** flip is browser-only (a scripted POST returns 401). Check
both Windows and Linux; `best_release.json` is the authoritative confirmation and the Files-page
banner caches and lies.

**macOS is a shipped platform (since 1.5.0, 2026-08-16).** The docs pass covers it too: any
platform table or install prose must name the Apple Silicon DMG (Intel = source build), the
Homebrew Hamlib note (`brew install hamlib` for CAT), and the verification list includes the
DMG's release URL, the site's `downloads.macos` entry, and the DMG in the SF release folder.

## 5. What none of this covers

Written down rather than chased with more checks, because overstating reach is how the next gap
hides.

- **Prose accuracy.** Every guard compares NAMES, TABLES and DATES. A paragraph that describes a
  workflow that changed passes everything here. Reading the release's own CHANGELOG against the
  pages that document those features is still a human pass.
- **In-app strings.** Tooltips and hint text are checked against nothing, in either direction.
- **A rename the registry never declared.** `docs-settings-pointers.test.ts` flags only names
  `TAB_ALIASES`/`SECTION_ALIASES` declare dead — which is what keeps it from firing on Windows'
  or N3FJP's Settings menus, and what makes it blind to a rename nobody wrote down.
- **A control that MOVED between two live sections.** This is the biggest gap and the dominant
  failure mode of a reorg, so treat it as a manual pass every time Settings is rearranged: read
  the release's own "moved X to Y" CHANGELOG lines and grep the doc set for the old home. In
  1.3.0 four pointers were green and wrong — the CAT broker cited under `Rig & CAT` (it is now
  `Transmit limits & sharing ▸ Share this radio with other programs`), and N3FJP/N1MM host and
  port cited under `Contesting ▸ Field Day Setup` (they are under `Logging & Connectors`). The
  guard cannot see these: it knows whether a NAME is alive, not whether that section still holds
  the control. The obvious mechanisation was tried and measured and does not work — the reasons
  are recorded at the bottom of `ui/src/docs-settings-pointers.test.ts`, read them before
  attempting it again.
- **Field labels inside `settings-reference.md`.** `gen-settings-reference.mjs` owns STRUCTURE
  only; the ~90 `###` field blocks are compared against nothing. 1.3.0 published three field
  names that do not exist ("Share my radio (CAT broker)", "CAT broker port", "Broker PTT").
- **Whether the paste actually happened.** Nothing in this repo can see the SourceForge or GitHub
  wiki. Verify by loading the page.
- **Whether an image shows what its alt text says.** `manual assets` checks that alt text EXISTS
  and is not a placeholder. A new capture committed under the old sentence passes it, which is
  the whole reason the freshness REVIEW ends with "reword the alt text".
- **Manual pages outside `docs/guide/`.** The site check lists `docs/guide/*.md` and asks the live
  index for each. `docs/quick-start.md` is also a chapter of the published manual
  (`/manual/quick-start`, and `build-manual-pdf.py` puts it first in the book) and is not in that
  list, so a 404 there would go unseen.
- **Release notes.** `docs/RELEASE_NOTES-*.md` are excluded from the link, asset and version-prose
  walks — they are a point-in-time record and rewriting them is the dishonest fix.

## 6. Then close the release

Per the runbook's own last step, in the same pass: record the release, and fix or retire whatever
the release superseded in the maintainer's working notes. Supersession happens at release events,
which is why the sweep is a release step rather than a periodic tidy.
