# Nexus — contributor & AI-agent guide

Nexus is a Rust + Tauri amateur-radio operations center (~200K lines own code, 16+ crates,
vendored WSJT-X DSP cores). This file is loaded by AI coding agents and read by humans; it holds
the invariants that are expensive to rediscover. Architecture map: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Build & verify

**Do not compose a gate list by hand — run `scripts/gates`.** It reads
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and derives the list, so it cannot come out a subset the way a
transcribed one does. Three failures in one day came from exactly that: a brief that forgot
`cargo fmt --all --check` (nine tasks "passed" with CI red), a merge gate that omitted the
Windows cross-compile and the UI suite (main went red on the push), and a fmt sweep that
silently skipped src-tauri. A memory saying "transcribe the list from ci.yml" already existed
and was violated anyway; transcription is the defect.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/gates --list` | every gate CI runs, grouped by job, with the exact command |
| `scripts/gates` | runs the ones runnable here, bare, printing each real exit code |
| `scripts/gates --list --unrunnable` | the jobs that **cannot** run here and why — for those, **pushing and reading the CI run IS the gate** |
| `scripts/gates --job test,ui` | scope a batch; the output states what it did NOT run |
| `scripts/gates --allow-partial` | accept incomplete coverage deliberately (see the exit codes) |

**Exit codes — `scripts/gates && git push` must not lie.** `0` every gate in the workflow ran
and passed · `1` a gate went **red** · `2` usage, or a workflow the reader could not read in
full · `3` everything that ran passed but coverage was **incomplete** (a gate could not run
here, a step was not understood, or `--job` scoped the run). On this box a bare run is normally
a 3, and that is the honest answer: a local run is not full coverage. `--allow-partial` turns a
3 into a 0 when the caller means it.

**Anything the tool does not fully understand is LOUD, never silent.** It is a subset reader of
both YAML and shell, so it meets shapes it cannot place; each is named in the output and costs
the run its full-coverage claim. This is not decoration — it shipped able to drop a whole job
(a legal `steps:` flush with its key), drop a gate riding behind `&&` on an apt-get line, and
drop a job-level `env:`, and still print *ALL GATES PASSED* and exit 0. If you teach the parser
a new shape, keep the refusal path: under-reporting coverage while printing success is worse
than no tool.

`node --test scripts/gates.test.mjs` holds the derivation property down: it plants a step in a
scratch copy of the workflow and fails if `--list` misses it. **It is a step in ci.yml**, so
`scripts/gates` derives it and runs it — the tool gates its own correctness. It used to run in
no workflow at all, which ci.yml's own comment answers better than this line can: a tool whose
only trigger is somebody remembering is not a gate. Never pipe a gate into `grep`/`tail`/`head`
— a pipe discards the exit status, which is how a faked-green gate shipped in 1.10.3.

### The traps — the WHY that a command list cannot carry

| Invariant | Detail |
|---|---|
| `cargo test --workspace` **excludes src-tauri** | src-tauri declares its own empty `[workspace]`, so it is not a member. Also run: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib --features radio` |
| `cargo fmt --all` **also excludes src-tauri** | Same boundary, so it needs its own gate: CI runs `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --check` (added 2026-09-07, after the drift it had accumulated with nothing watching reached 21 regions in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`; that sweep landed as its own formatting-only commit). A blanket sweep still belongs in its own commit, never inside a feature change. |
| src-tauri needs `--features radio` | Without it, ~13 phantom `tempo_audio` unresolved-crate errors. They are not real. |
| tempo-audio full tests | `cargo test -p tempo-audio --features device,serial` — and **clippy needs the same features**: CI lints `cargo clippy tempo-audio --features device,serial`; a plain `--workspace` clippy sweep misses feature-gated code (bit 2026-08-02) |
| propagation live fetchers | `--features live` |
| UI typecheck is `tsc -b` | Not `--noEmit` (project references). Build = `tsc -b && vite build`; tests = `npm test` (vitest) in `ui/` |
| Toolchain pinned 1.93.1 | CI pins exact stable; match it locally for clippy parity |
| CI is the source of truth | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — its comments document known traps, and `scripts/gates` derives the runnable list from it. Read them before changing build wiring. When you learn a new trap, encode it there (or here), not in session memory. |
| Windows and macOS are only gated by CI | `windows-cross` needs a MinGW FFTW3f build (`crates/tempo-fast-sys/build.rs` prints the configure line; `FFTW_MINGW_PREFIX`, default `/tmp/fftw-mingw`), `macos-check` needs a Mac. A `#[cfg(windows)]` body is type-checked by neither a Linux compile nor a local run. Push and read the run. |

## Working protocol (multiple agents/sessions run concurrently)

- **Before your first edit**: `git fetch` (check its EXIT STATUS — a failed fetch leaves a stale
  remote ref that looks exactly as authoritative as a current one); check
  `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main` (a stale base wastes the whole change set) and
  `git status` — if the tree carries uncommitted work that is not yours, do not edit, stash, or
  commit it. Use a fresh worktree: `git worktree add -b <branch> <path> origin/main`.
- **Independent fixes get their own branch off origin/main.** Never fold unrelated work into a
  topic branch — it entangles unrelated approval decisions at push time. Before proposing a merge
  target, ask what else that target would drag along: count the commits and look for `vendor/`,
  `NOTICE`, `COPYING`.
- **Before any merge**: re-check `git status`; record the pre-merge SHA. Branches move while you
  work here.
- Land small and often. Long-lived branches merge `origin/main` forward regularly.
- **Every git call takes `git -C <absolute path>`** — `status`, `log` and `diff` included. A shell
  cwd persists between commands, and an absolute path in an editor is not protection: it makes the
  mismatch *harder* to spot, because the file edit lands in the right tree while the commit runs in
  the wrong one. A branch name resolves from any worktree, so a push can "succeed" and carry a tip
  that does not contain your fix. **Verify a push by reading the remote ref back**
  (`git -C <abs> show origin/main:<path>`), never by the push output.
- **A worktree is a single-writer resource** — one agent, one session, one worktree. Two writers in
  one tree revert each other's edits mid-flight and produce a red typecheck at a seam neither
  diff explains. If files change under you that you did not write, stop and report rather than
  working through it.
- **Stage by explicit path.** `git add <paths>` then `git commit -- <those paths>` — never
  `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git commit -a`. The staging area is shared state: between your
  `git add` and your `git commit`, a concurrent agent's broad add can sweep your files into *its*
  commit under a message describing none of them. The damage is silent — both sets of gates pass
  and nothing looks wrong until someone reads the log. Confirm with
  `git diff --cached --name-only` that every path is yours before committing.
- **Never run a working-tree-wide destructive git op in a shared checkout**: `reset --hard`,
  `checkout .` / `restore .`, `clean -fd`, or `git stash`. They destroy every concurrent agent's
  uncommitted work, and uncommitted work leaves no git object — there is no reflog entry and
  nothing to recover. `git stash` is the trap: it looks successful and silently pockets everyone
  else's changes, so the loss is found later. To undo your own commit use
  `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (moves the branch pointer, leaves every working tree alone); to get a
  clean tree, clone to a throwaway path instead.
- Temporary/plan files: `tasks/` is gitignored and machine-local — never `git add -f` it. Don't
  leave pointers to it in shipped material either; a `See tasks/specs/*.md` clause in a code
  comment leaks the shape of a private tree even when the file itself never ships.
- **A check that found nothing is not a result until a positive control passes.** Before
  concluding from a search, a guard, or an exit code, run the *same* check against something that
  MUST trip it. If the control also comes back clean, the check is broken, not the world — this is
  the project's most-repeated defect class, and it bites hardest when the answer is reassuring.
  Three things this specifically means: a guard must be shown both to fire and not to fire (one
  direction is half a test); `exit 0` is not evidence that work happened, so count the artifact —
  files tracked versus on disk, the version the live URL serves, bytes on the remote; and the
  control must act on **the artifact the code actually reads**, not a copy of it, so point the
  tool at your sandbox with its own path override and confirm the path it resolved.

## Hard rules (approval-gated — ask the maintainer, every time)

- **Never** push, tag, publish a release, deploy, or run a mirror/publish script without explicit
  maintainer approval for that specific action. Prior approval does not carry over. The release
  half is mechanical: pushing a `v*` tag fires `release.yml` and publishes a public GitHub
  Release, so the pre-push hook refuses it unless `NEXUS_RELEASE_APPROVED=1` is set for that push.
- The operator's personal identity must never reach a public surface — not a commit, not a
  fixture, not a comment, not a doc. Commits use the **project identity only**
  (`KD9TAW <kd9taw@protonmail.com>`, repo-local git config — the global gitconfig is a different
  identity and must never reach a commit here). This is the one leak that cannot be fixed by a
  follow-up commit: once pushed, the string is in public history until someone rewrites it.
- **Destructive history operations on a public remote** — force-push, history rewrite, branch
  deletion — are break-glass only and need their own approval, with a mirror backup taken first.
  They are never the fix for a mistake you can fix by moving forward.
- `.githooks/pre-push` is the one gate in this project that is mechanism rather than prose:
  wrong-remote guard, release-tag gate, identity, a **per-commit** content scrub, and a
  licence/NOTICE guard. Each names its own deliberate override; read that file's header before
  working around one.
  **Enable it with an ABSOLUTE `core.hooksPath` — never the relative `.githooks`.** Git resolves
  a relative hooksPath inside the *checked-out worktree*, so on any branch predating
  `.githooks/pre-push` it silently runs no hook at all (43 of 51 local branches were in that
  state when this was found). Point `core.hooksPath` at a shim in the git common dir that
  `exec`s `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.githooks/pre-push` and *refuses* when it is absent:
  `git config core.hooksPath "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/nexus-hooks"`.
  The scrub patterns are deliberately **not** in this repo (it is public); the hook reads
  `$HOME/.nexus-leak-patterns` (0600, one extended regex per line, no blank lines).
- **Vendored/OSS additions**: per-file license review, GPL-3.0-only compatibility, source headers
  intact, NOTICE entry, README credit — before commit, not after. Check the licence **per file
  (headers)**, not the repo-level claim, and where it cannot be confirmed say so rather than
  asserting it. **GPL-2-only or proprietary is not compatible — stop.** The pre-push hook enforces
  the mechanical half only: a push that adds files under a vendor path, or adds third-party licence
  body text, must also touch `NOTICE` (override `NEXUS_ALLOW_VENDOR=1`). It cannot tell you the
  entry is *correct*, and it does not review the licence for you.
- **Credential and key handling** — anything that could cause a secret to be printed, logged,
  embedded in a build, or committed — changes only with approval. Keys live in the OS keychain or
  a machine-local file outside the repo, never in it, and never in a test fixture.
- **FT-mode TX/timing/QSO-sequencing changes** require explicit maintainer sign-off. WSJT-X
  behavior is a compatibility contract; on-air correctness cannot be verified in CI. A change that
  makes Nexus behave differently from WSJT-X on the air needs sign-off even when it looks like an
  improvement — restoring parity is the goal, not improving on it.
- Transmit-path safety invariants are load-bearing: **never weaken one to fix a test.** The
  TX-enable latch (defaults OFF at launch and stays the universal TX gate), license-privilege
  gating, identity validation at the keying boundary, and the wall-clock TX watchdog each exist
  because its absence caused or would cause an on-air incident. A failing test is evidence about
  your change, not about the invariant — fix the change or the test setup, never relax the guard,
  widen its window, or delete its assertion.

## Conventions

- Comment-dense Rust (`//!` module headers everywhere) — match it. Read the module header before
  editing a file; they carry real contracts.
- Tests colocated (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`) with fixtures in `<crate>/tests/fixtures/`. Bug fixes
  ship with a failing-first repro test.
- CHANGELOG: Keep-a-Changelog, operator-facing prose. New work goes under `## [Unreleased]`;
  `scripts/release-prep <version>` renames it and aligns all version manifests at release time.
- **Versioning — the HEADLINE RULE (operator ruling, 2026-08-17).** A **minor** bump requires a
  *headline*: one user-visible capability an operator would name if asked what's new (a new mode,
  a new platform, a new cockpit). **Everything else is a patch** — including multi-fix batches,
  however large. The rule exists because the literal semver reading (any feature ⇒ minor) turned
  the minor number into a batch counter: 1.0.0 → 1.6.0 in twelve days, with 1.5.0 and 1.6.0
  shipping fifteen hours apart, which left the number unable to signal that a release mattered.
  Next release under the rule is **1.7.0** (PSK31 + QPSK31, the macOS platform work).
- **Tester builds never consume a public version number.** They take a prerelease suffix
  (`1.7.0-test1`), never the next free patch. A tester build sharing a number with a later public
  release strands its holder forever: the updater only offers a *strictly newer* version, so
  same-number-different-content is never offered, and the tester believes they are current.
- CSS/UI: theme via CSS variables (`--state-*`, `--snr-*`); check a variable exists in *both*
  themes before using it.

## UI layout contract (2026-07 overhaul — read before building any view or pane)

The window-sizing bug class that plagued 0.4–0.21 is dead only while these rules hold. The spec
is the header comment of `ui/src/cockpit-panes.css`; enforcement is `cockpit-panes.test.ts`,
`cockpit-shells.test.ts`, `responsive-vocab.test.ts` (they **compute cascade winners** — never
add a regex-presence CSS test, that is how dead fixes shipped twice).

- A cockpit shell has four child kinds only: header, scope, ONE pane region, one TX dock.
  Every operator-content block renders through `CockpitPaneFrame` with a **role**:
  `fit="content"` for control strips (exactly content height — a strip cannot use surplus),
  fill + `weight` for feeds and the log column. A pane never sizes itself; structural size
  lives in `cockpit-panes.css` (flat selectors, fenced) and only there.
- **The stop line** (2026-08-03, fifth wording). **The rule, and it is safety:** *the operator must
  never be unable to stop a transmission.* Mechanically, and this is the whole of it: **in every
  cockpit, at least one control that stops a transmission renders OUTSIDE every ⊞-removable pane.**
  Hide every id in that cockpit's vocabulary, singly and all at once, and those controls are still on
  screen and no more disabled than they were — no vocabulary id reaches them, so hiding one is
  unrepresentable rather than guarded. **The controls that hold it up** (re-verified against the code
  2026-08-03; only `halt_tx` is universal, so each names what it stops): Phone — PTT (dock; the mic
  key it holds), Stop TX (header → `halt_tx`), Tune (the tune carrier only), Space (window keyup =
  PTT-release, and only while Lock is off); CW — Stop TX (→ `stopCw`+`haltTx`), Tune, Esc; Operate —
  Stop TX (`.op-btn.stop` in `.cockpit-qso` → `halt_tx`, the only control here that cuts an over in
  flight), Tune, Esc; RTTY — Stop TX (never disabled), the dock's Esc/Stop macro
  (`disabled={!(sending || latched)}`, live exactly while an over is on the air **or** continuous TX
  is latched), Tune, Esc (a window `keydown` bound only while RTTY is the visible view), the TX-enable
  latch and the sequencer's Abort (rendered only while auto runs); PSK — Stop TX, the dock's Esc/Stop
  macro (RTTY's shape and predicate), Tune, Esc (bound only while PSK is visible), the TX-enable
  latch; SSTV — Stop (`.sstv-tx-bar`) + the TX-enable latch.
  **Tune reached RTTY and PSK on 2026-08-20**, with the RF-power slider it exists to set — the two
  keyboard cockpits had been shipping without the header's own declared base controls (power, Tune,
  ATU), which is the discoverability defect the triage found in a different form ("the ATU button is
  in the header in three cockpits and in the TX strip in the fourth"). Both are swept.
  **RTTY's continuous-TX ("TX") button is a SENDER, not a stop** — clicking it off stops accepting
  characters and lets what was already typed finish keying, so it must never be added to the sweep's
  `stopControls`. It is also the one transmission in the app with no precomputed end, so it carries
  a stop the others do not need and no button can express: `Engine::poll_rtty_stream` re-checks every
  TX gate on EVERY radio-loop tick and drops the latch (not merely the feed) when one goes down, so a
  section change, a QSY out of privileges, a tune or a radio handoff unkeys within one tick. Two wall
  clocks bound it — the ordinary TX watchdog (restarted by a keystroke exactly as by a send) and
  `Engine::RTTY_MAX_LATCH_MS`, a hard per-over ceiling no typing can extend (the `MAX_TUNE_MS`
  pattern) — and the loop renders at most `RTTY_STREAM_AHEAD_CHARS` of audio ahead, so a wedged loop
  expires into an unkey instead of holding PTT. **Operate's TX On/Off and
  S&P are NOT stop controls and were removed from this list:** `set_tx_enabled` deliberately does not
  arm `slot_tx_abort` (operator 2026-07-31 — the FT over in flight completes; the button's own tooltip
  says so), and `onSetMode('qso-monitor')` ends the CQ run and drops the queue without arming anything.
  **The latch is a stop in RTTY and SSTV only:** there `set_tx_enabled(false)` arms `rtty_abort` /
  `sstv_abort`, which the audio loop turns into flush + unkey while an over is keying, and it stays a
  *button* through those overs because `radio.transmitting` is the slot-TX indicator alone. APRS is a
  seventh cockpit with no vocabulary at all, so the rule holds by construction — and it renders no stop
  control; its TX On/Off is an arm latch that only holds the queue. The TopBar's TX cluster backstops
  none of them — App hides it in Operate and in Phone/CW/RTTY/PSK/SSTV/APRS — so each cockpit stands on
  its own. **The sweeps do not match this census one for one** (the claim that they did was false for
  four of the five swept cockpits): swept are Phone's PTT/Stop TX/Tune, CW's Stop TX/Tune, RTTY's Stop
  TX/Esc-Stop macro/Tune/latch, PSK's Stop TX/Esc-Stop macro/Tune/latch and SSTV's Stop/latch (the one
  exact match); Operate's guard list is the
  whole TX/sequencer surface of the strip, not a stop-control list. Census-only, and outside both
  sweeps by construction: Phone's Space and CW's/Operate's Esc (keyboard-only) and RTTY's sequencer
  Abort (conditionally rendered).
  **Nothing else about a pane bears on whether it may be hidden.** A pane *may* host a stop control
  of its own, and it goes away with the pane: **two do** — Phone's `voiceKeyer` (■ Stop → `stopVoice`
  → `Engine::stop_voice`, which flushes the output ring and unkeys) and RTTY's `stream` (the "Auto on"
  toggle: off-click → `seq.abort()` + `Engine::rtty_stop()`, queue cleared and unkeyed). Those are
  **conveniences built on the guarantee, never what holds it up.** A pane *may* start a transmission:
  **six do** — the voice keyer, Operate's Tx messages (Tx6 = Call CQ → `startCq`) and its two decode
  panes and two rosters (double-click → `call_station_ctx`, which enables TX and keys the period);
  all hideable, correctly. A pane's hide *may* end something in flight: **one does** (the voice
  keyer), and that earns a note, not a refusal.
  **What is forbidden — four things, read off that census:** (1) giving a listed control an id, or
  moving one *into* a ⊞-removable pane, which is how it would get one; (2) gating one on a pane id
  without moving it (`disabled={!shown('dsp')}`) — mounted and dead is the same loss as gone;
  (3) shipping a cockpit whose *only* stop control is inside a removable pane (none does; RTTY is
  closest — `stream` is its whole vocabulary — and four sit outside it, of which **three are live**
  while an over is actually keying outside an auto sequence: Stop TX, the Esc/Stop macro and the
  latch, the sequencer's Abort not being rendered then); (4) adding a **pane-resident** stop control to a
  sweep's `stopControls`, which would make the sweep demand its pane be unhideable.
  **The practice, and it is courtesy, not safety:** if hiding a pane *ends* something in flight, its
  ⊞ entry should say so before the tick — a stop the operator did not ask for reads as a dropout.
  That is why the voice keyer's entry warns (its unmount aborts a message and discards a recording);
  a pane whose hide ends nothing must carry no warning. Nothing is admitted or refused on it.
  *Four earlier wordings were falsified, and the record is kept in `panelState.ts` and
  `cockpit-panes.css` because it is what stops a fifth proxy:* "a pane that can only start a
  transmission may be hidden" excluded the pane it was written to admit (the keyer has a Stop
  button); "a pane that *may be hidden* has a hide path that is itself a stop" bound every hideable
  pane, forbidding 23 of the 24 entries in `ALL_PANEL_VOCABULARIES`; "a pane that *can start* a
  transmission may be hidden only if its hide is a stop" was violated by shipped code — Operate's
  `txmsgs` starts a CQ, is hideable, and its hide stops nothing and says nothing; and "every control
  that *stops* a transmission has no id in any pane vocabulary" was falsified twice over by the
  keyer's own ■ Stop and by RTTY's Auto toggle, both stop controls living inside panes that *have*
  ids. All four named a property of a pane or of a control; the guarantee is a property of **the
  screen that remains**.
  Two guards, and neither is the rule alone: `panelState.test.ts` checks **names** across every
  vocabulary (`ALL_PANEL_VOCABULARIES`, itself checked against every vocabulary the module
  exports); `components/stop-line.test.tsx` checks **wiring** for Phone/CW/RTTY/PSK/SSTV — with every id
  in a cockpit's vocabulary removed, singly and all at once, every stop control **on that cockpit's
  list** must still be in the document, found by accessible name, and no more disabled than it was.
  Operate is swept in `OperateCockpit.structure.test.tsx`, and that sweep is **presence-only** (see
  the next bullet) — not the same check. A stop control gated on an id called `dsp` is caught only by
  the wiring sweeps; a dead `ptt` entry only by the name guard. Render each cockpit with **the props
  App gives it** — the TX-enable latch only exists when `onSetTxEnabled` is passed, and omitting it
  made the RTTY/SSTV sweeps blind to a control on both their lists.
- **What the stop-line guards do NOT prove.** Written down rather than chased with more guards:
  neither sweep can see a stop control that is **present, enabled and inert** (an
  `onClick={() => {}}` on Stop TX passed the whole suite — 2106 tests at the time); the name backstop
  is **exact-word** on whole normalised ids, so `txStop`/`pttRow`/`killTx` pass it — substring
  matching is not an option, it rejects `voiceKeyer` for containing `keyer`; the **practice
  note-pairing is computed for Phone only**, with no coverage test across vocabularies of the kind
  the name guard has (that costs courtesy, not the guarantee); **Operate's sweep is presence-only**
  (no baseline, no `disabled` comparison, no one-id-at-a-time pass) and is not the equivalent of the
  four-cockpit sweep; **no sweep can see a keyboard-only or conditionally rendered stop** (both look
  for buttons by accessible name in one fixture state, so Phone's Space, CW's/Operate's Esc and RTTY's
  sequencer Abort are census-only by construction); and that a *newly added* stop control reached its
  cockpit's sweep list is a human step.
- Responsive behavior: `[data-viewport='xs|sm|md|lg|xl']` + `--vh-eff`/`--vw-eff` only. Never a
  size-based `@media`, never raw `vh/vw` inside `.app` (zoom-blind) — the portaled
  `.ui-dialog`/`.ui-tooltip` are the one permanent exception (their content re-applies
  `--ui-zoom`; their boxes measure the real window).
- Anything persisted that encodes a size/position/scale is **clamped on load** against the
  current window/monitors, not just at drag time.
- **The supported floor is 1024×768** (operator, 2026-08-03). Design for 1024 and up; do not
  contort a layout to fit smaller, and do not reject a better design because it is tight
  below the floor. Smaller windows must still never TRAP the operator — nothing unreachable,
  no dead scrollbar — but they are not a design target. Sweep sizes are in the `ui-layout`
  skill.
- Auto-following feeds use `usePinnedScroll` (never a bare `scrollTop = scrollHeight`);
  programmatic `focus()` uses `preventScroll` + `scrollIntoView({block:'nearest'})`.
- Flex/grid growers must point at content that can actually stretch; a container that clips
  (`overflow:hidden`) may never have hard-floored descendants without an interposed scroller.
