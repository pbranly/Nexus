/**
 * The single CAT rate a rig can run — for the rigs whose Hamlib backend states it as a fact.
 *
 * ## THE BASIS RULE. An entry may rest on ONE fact, and this is it.
 *
 * A model is listed **only** when `rigctl -m <model> --dump-caps` against the bundled Hamlib
 * reports `Serial speed: N..N` — `serial_rate_min == serial_rate_max`, the backend saying there
 * is no choice of rate at all. The value is that N. Nothing else may put a rig in this table:
 * not a baud menu out of the radio's manual, not a low declared max, not a make.
 *
 * Picking such a rig sets the baud to N, because on a one-rate rig every other value is a
 * setting that cannot work. There is nothing to protect and so no judgement to get wrong.
 *
 * A rig with **no entry keeps whatever baud is set** and is never touched. Finding a working
 * rate for those is `baud_ladder.rs`'s job — it PROBES, and a probe cannot be wrong about a
 * radio the way a table can.
 *
 * ### Why the rule is this narrow — four rounds, each fixing the last one's rig and breaking a new one
 *
 * The predecessor of this table carried a per-radio `{rates, preferred}` transcribed out of
 * hardware manuals across 61 models, and it clobbered a working setting every round:
 * an FT-847 running 57,600 rewritten to 4,800; an FX-4 (fixed 115,200) shipped unable to talk;
 * three Kenwoods dead on a fresh install; and finally an IC-746 row reading `[9600, 19200]`
 * against a manual (Set Mode item 27) that offers 300/1200/4800/9600/19200/AUTO — so an
 * operator running one at 4,800 was silently moved to 19,200, which is the FT-847 bug again,
 * created by the fix for the FT-847 bug.
 *
 * **The root cause was the data, not the logic.** Hand transcription across 61 models has a
 * failure rate, and each wrong row silently overwrites a radio that was working. So the table
 * now holds only what the backend declares, and is checked against it: the caps of every rig
 * the picker offers are dumped by `scripts/gen-hamlib-serial-speeds.mjs` into
 * `__fixtures__/hamlibSerialSpeeds.json`, and `SettingsPanel.rigpicker.test.tsx` fails if a row
 * appears whose model is not `min == max` there, if its rate is not that value, or if a
 * one-rate rig in the catalog is missing a row. **A row cannot be added from a manual.**
 *
 * ⚠️ Deliberately NOT here, and it stays that way: rigs whose declared max is merely low.
 * Hamlib does not enforce `serial_rate_min`/`_max` — measured, model 3085 opens clean at
 * 115,200 against a declared max of 19,200 — and Nexus drives Icoms past it on purpose (the
 * native CI-V scope REQUIRES 115,200 on an IC-705, and `civ/scope.rs` records an IC-9700
 * verified at 57,600 against a declared 38,400). Only `min == max` is a fact; a range is not.

  // model and audio devices onto the ACTIVE radio's profile — persisted, silent, and
  // unrecoverable. Operator report, 2026-07-25: both radios ended up on one set of comm ports.
  //
  // ⚠️ TWO WRITES, NOT ONE (#173). Routing the ENTIRE save through the per-radio verb was the
  // other half of the same mistake: `radioPatch()` carries per-radio CAT/audio/PTT/rotator
  // fields only, so while the panel was editing a non-active radio EVERY station-wide edit was
  // discarded — and the panel said "Saved". The reporter's was QRZ auto-upload, made on Logging

  // `ampModel`/`ampPort` were each fixed by adding one more name to the patch, and no name
  // added there could ever have reached a station-wide setting. So send both.

  // ORDER MATTERS: station-wide FIRST. A settings payload carries the whole `radios` array, and

                      ⚠️ THIS SENTENCE HAS BEEN WRONG TWICE. It first said TCI was "a WebSocket
                      protocol Nexus can't drive" (false — Hamlib has a TCI backend). It was then
                      rewritten to send the operator to model 7, on the evidence that
                      `strings libhamlib-4.dll` contains `tci1x.c`. That does not follow, and it
                      was checked the wrong way: source strings can be present while the backend
                      is not registered in the build. Measured on the real delivery path —
                        rigctld.exe -m 7 -r 127.0.0.1:50001  ->  "Unknown rig num 7, or
                        initialization error."
                      while `-m 1` starts fine, and `rigctl -l` lists no TCI/Expert/SunSDR entry
                      at all. Model 7 was removed from the catalog (2026-08-06); pointing anyone
                      at it was pointing them at a daemon that refuses to start.

                      The check that settles this class is one command: start rigctld on the
                      model and see whether it does. Do not infer a backend from a grep. */}

                  cable only they can see, replacing an inference that has now been wrong three
                  times. They sit behind this collapsed disclosure on purpose, and both hints
                  WARN rather than describe, because the failure mode is silent and asymmetric:
                  Hamlib's `rig_open` refuses `<line>_state` on the line it is keying with,
                  returns -RIG_ECONF, and rigctld DOES NOT EXIT — it goes on serving a rig it
                  never opened, so the operator sees CAT connected and a radio that ignores it.
                  Which backends accept these and which lose CAT to them cannot be determined
                  here: there is no serial rig on the dev box and CI cannot watch a pin
                  (NEEDS-BENCH, and rigctld_proc.rs says the same from its end). Both default to

                programs at once, no swapping cables and nothing to release.

                The address existed all along — `rigctld_port` is per-radio and validated

                {/* The diagnostic log has no toggle — it is written from the first moments of
                    startup, deliberately, because the failures worth diagnosing are the early
                    ones. That is exactly why it needs a line HERE: it was the one
                    operator-facing artefact nothing in the interface named, on a file we ask
                    people to send us when something goes wrong.

                    #101 (akhepcat) asked for a way to turn it off, and the answer is no —
                    ruled 2026-09-07 and written into the hint below rather than left as a
                    silent “Always on”. A log that can be switched off is missing on exactly
                    the run that needed it, and the switch would have to live in a settings
                    file the failing launch may never have reached. The tier that IS
                    switchable is the field underneath. */}

                    diagnosing are the ones that die during startup, before any setting has been
                    read, so a log you could turn off would be missing on precisely the launch
                    you needed it for. It is a plain-text record of what Nexus did — startup
                    steps, the CAT and audio device open, updater checks, and any failure — so a
                    “it won’t start” or “it stopped decoding” report has something to look at.
