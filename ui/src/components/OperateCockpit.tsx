// ⚠️ THIS FILE IS ON THE MIGRATED LIST (i18n/hardcoded-strings.test.ts). Every reading in this
// cockpit is DATA and stays in the code — the dial, the audio offsets in Hz, the band, the
// tier, the decode depth, the split TX frequency, the next-slot seconds — and so does the
// technical vocabulary the header is built out of: the mode chips' own names and T/R slot
// lengths, `Native`/`Companion` (the backend's own words for the signal source, which the
// group tooltip interpolates beside them), the `Rx`/`Tx` of the two DF spinners, the `Hz`
// unit and the `SPLIT ▲` and `HOUND` annunciators. What moved is the prose around them.
//
// Nothing that stops or keys a transmission is in this file: Operate's stop line is Stop TX
// and Tune in `OperateQsoStrip.tsx` (both deferred, see that file's header) plus the Esc
// binding below, which is a keyboard handler with no string of its own.

  // is the one container here that is already an interposed scroller (`overflow-y: auto`,
  // styles.css), which is the same structural reason the CW and Phone log panes can host the
  // full card: it scrolls INSIDE the rail instead of squeezing the cockpit. It also lands
  // where the click did in Classic — the Stations roster is directly beneath it.
  //
  // It costs the rail NOTHING until a call is selected: unselected there is no element at
  // all, so the idle layout is unchanged. Selected, it takes rail height from the roster
  // (which keeps its `flex: 1.8` share of what is left) and the rail scrolls if the pair no
  // longer fits. Two known limits, stated rather than papered over: with the whole side rail
  // ⊞-hidden the card goes with it, and in Roster layout the rail is opposite the roster the
  // click happened in.
  // WHICH station the card is about, and the order is the whole of it: an explicit
  // click WINS over the sequencer. `selectedCall` is the operator saying "show me this
  // one"; `snap.qso.dxcall` is the station the sequencer is actually working, and it
  // fills in when they have not clicked — which is most of an FT8 session, because
  // double-clicking a decode starts a QSO without ever selecting a peer. Reading only
  // the click left the card blank through every contact the operator ran; reading only

            way in, not a second source of truth.

            TWO STATES, because there are only two: `superhound` is a retired alias the engine
            treats as plain Hound, so it renders the button ON and is never offered as a choice
            of its own.

            NOT A STOP CONTROL, and not part of the stop line: it neither starts nor stops a
            transmission. It sits here with the other header state controls, outside every
            ⊞-removable pane, and carries no vocabulary id.

            Toggling it mid-QSO is safe by construction — a contact in flight keeps the rules it
            started under (engine.rs `hound_split`); the toggle governs the NEXT one. */}

/**
 * THE CALLSIGN CARD FOR THE FT COCKPIT (#168 — "the details card is missing here").
 *
 * The card is `RecallPanel`, the same one the CW and Phone log strips have shown since
 * 2026-07-31, and none of what it shows is new: the prior-contact list, the confirmed
 * count, the DXCC/band/mode slot flags, the distance/bearing line and the private note all
 * already worked. What was missing was a PATH to it from this cockpit. `RecallPanel` had
 * exactly one caller — LogEntry — and Operate hosts no LogEntry, so clicking a roster row
 * here only ever armed the Spot button.
 *
 * This is therefore the assembly LogEntry does inline, with the log FORM left out: read the
 * logbook, resolve the award entity, ask the callbook, hand the result over. Three
 * deliberate differences from LogEntry, each because this cockpit is not a log strip:
 *
 *   · THE LOGBOOK IS RE-READ ON EVERY SELECTION. LogEntry reads once per mount and again
 *     after it logs, which is complete for a strip that is the only thing writing. Operate
 *     logs in the BACKGROUND — the sequencer files a contact the moment the exchange
 *     completes, with no click — so a once-per-mount read would show a stale "previous
 *     contacts" list for the rest of the session, and would tell an operator they had never
 *     worked a station they worked ten minutes ago. A roster click is an operator action,
 *     not a poll.
 *   · THE DECODED GRID SEEDS THE CARD. The station is on screen because we decoded it, and
 *     an FT8 frame carries a square. Using it when the callbook has none is what puts a
 *     distance and a bearing on the card for an operator with no QRZ subscription at all —
 *     the callbook's own square still wins when there is one, being the finer of the two.
 *   · THE LOOKUP IS SILENT AND DEBOUNCED. No credentials, no subscription, a call the
 *     callbook does not know: all of those are ordinary here, and none may put a toast on
 *     screen for a roster click. The card degrades to identity + history + badges, exactly
 *     as the CW cockpit's does today.
