//
// THE STOP LINE, COMPUTED — the wiring half of the rule in features/panelState.ts.
//
//   THE OPERATOR MUST NEVER BE UNABLE TO STOP A TRANSMISSION.
//
// Mechanically: in every cockpit, at least one control that stops a transmission renders
// OUTSIDE every ⊞-removable pane. This file is what computes that half of it.
//
// panelState.test.ts holds the NAME half: no vocabulary may contain an id named for a stop
// control. That half reads names and nothing else, so it walks straight past a stop control
// gated on an id called `dsp` — which is exactly the hole the old rule's "enforced by
// computation" claim papered over.
//
// THIS suite reads wiring and ignores names. For each cockpit it drives EVERY id in the
// REAL vocabulary through the REAL hide path — one at a time, then all at once, the state
// an operator reaches by unticking down the menu — and looks for the stop controls by their
// ACCESSIBLE NAME. If any panel id gates any of them, in any combination, this goes red and
// says which id took which control.
//
// WHAT BELONGS IN A CASE'S `stopControls`, AND WHAT MUST NOT. The list is the
// OUTSIDE-EVERY-PANE set: the controls the guarantee rests on. A stop control that lives
// INSIDE a ⊞-removable pane is deliberately absent, and there are two of them in the app —
// Phone's voice keyer hosts ■ Stop (→ stopVoice → Engine::stop_voice, which flushes the
// output ring and unkeys), and RTTY's `stream` pane hosts the "Auto on" toggle (off-click →
// seq.abort() + Engine::rtty_stop(): queue cleared, rig unkeyed). Both go away with their
// pane, and that is allowed: a pane's own stop is a CONVENIENCE built on the guarantee, never
// what holds it up. Adding either one below would make this sweep demand its pane be
// unhideable — which is exactly how the FIRST wording of the rule excluded the voice keyer,
// the pane it was written to admit. Do not "fix" a red by unhiding a pane; check first
// whether the control you added belongs on the list at all.
//
// EACH COCKPIT IS RENDERED WITH THE PROPS APP GIVES IT, and that is load-bearing rather than
// tidiness: CockpitHeader draws the TX-enable latch (▼ TX On / ■ TX Off) only when it is
// handed `onSetTxEnabled`, which App passes to RTTY, PSK, SSTV and JS8 — in JS8 the latch is
// NOT a stop (slotted mode), so the JS8 case passes the prop for parity with App and lists
// Stop TX + Tune only. RTTY and SSTV have no other Enable-Tx affordance, the TopBar's being
// hidden with the digital chrome. The first version of this file omitted the prop, so for
// RTTY and SSTV the latch was never in the document and the sweep proved nothing about the
// one control the rule names BY NAME (gating it on a panel id in either cockpit was green).
// Phone and CW arm elsewhere and legitimately have no latch on screen; their `stopControls`
// say so by not listing one.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT: whether a pane can START a transmission. Six can —
// Operate's Tx messages, its two decode panes and its two rosters, Phone's voice keyer — and
// all of them are hideable, correctly. The rule is about what is left ON SCREEN and nothing
// else, so the only lists here are `stopControls`.
//
// WHY THE HEADER IS NOT STUBBED HERE. Every *.structure.test.tsx mocks CockpitHeader down
// to an empty <header>, which is right for a shell census and useless for this: Stop TX and
// Tune live INSIDE that header in Phone, CW and RTTY, so a stubbed header can only prove a
// container rendered. This file pays the mock cost to render the real one, so "Stop TX is
// reachable" is an assertion about the button the operator presses.
//
// Operate is swept in OperateCockpit.structure.test.tsx instead ("every protected control
// renders INSIDE .cockpit-qso with every panel id removed") — its stop controls are in the
// merged QSO strip rather than a CockpitHeader, and that suite already owns the mock
// surface for them. It is driven off OPERATE_PANEL_IDS for the same reason as here.
// IT IS NOT THIS SWEEP'S EQUIVALENT, and it is not described as one: it takes no baseline,
// compares no `disabled` state and hides every id at once rather than one at a time. It
// catches a control that VANISHES; it would not catch one left mounted-and-disabled.
//
// EACH LIST BELOW IS A SUBSET OF ITS COCKPIT'S CENSUS, NOT A COPY OF IT. panelState.ts once
// claimed "each cockpit's sweep list is the same set, which is how this is checkable in
// minutes"; that was false for four of the five swept cockpits. Two kinds of holder cannot be
// swept here, by construction rather than by oversight — this file finds BUTTONS BY ACCESSIBLE
// NAME, in one fixed fixture state:
//   · KEYBOARD-ONLY. Phone's Space bar (window keyup → setPtt(false), only while Lock is off)
//     and CW's Esc (window keydown → the same abort() Stop TX calls) have no accessible name
//     and no element. Operate's Esc is the same, in its own sweep.
//   · CONDITIONALLY RENDERED. RTTY's auto-sequencer Abort renders only inside
//     `{auto && seqState !== 'idle'}`, and the `rttyState` fixture above is auto:false /
//     seqState:'idle' — so there is nothing on screen to look for. Adding a second RTTY case
//     with an in-flight sequence would sweep it; not done here, and not claimed.
// SSTV is the one cockpit whose list and census match exactly.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT COMPUTE, stated rather than guarded:
//   · A STOP CONTROL THAT IS PRESENT, ENABLED AND INERT. Every assertion here is about the
//     button being in the document and operable — never about what pressing it does.
//     Verified: `onClick={() => {}}` on CockpitHeader's Stop TX passes this file and the
//     whole suite. Nothing below would go red.
//   · The keyboard-only and conditionally rendered holders above.
//   · That a NEWLY ADDED stop control was added to the list below. Adding one is a human
//     step. Each cockpit's list is its case's `stopControls`, so the next person editing a
//     dock finds it beside the cockpit it guards.
// What IS computed is that every vocabulary in the app has a sweep at all — the last test
// in the file, driven off ALL_PANEL_VOCABULARIES, so a sixth cockpit cannot ship without one.
//
// FIELD DAY HAS NO SWEEP OF ITS OWN, AND THAT IS NOT AN OMISSION. Field Day is a MODE the app
// enters, not a screen: the contacts are made in the five cockpits swept below, whose stop
// lines are the same on the event weekend as off it. The Field Day section itself draws no
// transmit control at all — it is setup, score, sections, bonuses, the log and the club board.
