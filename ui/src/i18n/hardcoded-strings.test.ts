// THE GUARD — a migrated surface cannot drift back to hardcoded English.
//
// Migrating 250 files is a long job, and every long job in this tree has the same failure: the
// migrated part decays while the rest is being done, because nothing stops the next feature
// from adding a plain `title="…"` next to a translated one. So this exists before the second
// batch, not after the last.
//
// IT COMPUTES. The detector PARSES each file with the TypeScript compiler (already a
// devDependency — no new one) and asks the syntax tree which strings reach an operator: JSX
// text, the handful of attributes that are read aloud or shown on hover, string literals used
// as JSX children, and the first argument of the calls that put prose on screen. It never
// greps for a phrase, and it never asserts a phrase is absent — the presence-matching CSS
// tests that let dead fixes ship twice are the reason that rule exists in this project.
//
// IT IS PROVEN TO FIRE ON EVERY RUN, not once by hand: `the detector fires` below parses a
// fixture written to break every rule and asserts it is caught, kind by kind. A guard that has
// only ever been green is a guard nobody has tested. (It was also driven red by hand against
// the real files while it was written — a `title="Stop"` added to SettingsStation.tsx produced
// `components/SettingsStation.tsx:114 attr:title "Stop"`.)
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ⚠️ SCOPE — WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, stated because a partial guard read as a total one is
// worse than none.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//   • It checks exactly the files in MIGRATED. Everything else — including the other 8,900
//     lines of SettingsPanel.tsx, which appears in PARTIAL for its keys alone — is
//     deliberately unchecked and still hardcoded English.
//   • The list only ever GROWS. Removing a file from it is how a surface silently un-migrates,
//     so removal needs the same scrutiny as the migration did.
//   • It cannot see prose that reaches the operator from Rust (~440 `format!` sites), from a
//     data registry (`features/registry.ts` labels, `settings/registry.ts` labels/keywords),
//     or from a string built with `+`. Those are phase-2 and phase-3 decisions.
//   • It cannot tell a WRONG translation from a right one, and it cannot tell that a key is
//     used in the right place. It only proves the English is not baked into the JSX.
//   • A prose string hidden behind a named constant (`const MSG = 'Saved'; <b>{MSG}</b>`)
//     passes. That is the deliberate escape hatch invariant TOKENS use (see STATION_EXAMPLES),
//     and it costs an author a conscious act.

  // Three things this batch settles that the fourteen before it did not. A REGISTRY OF
  // FEATURES migrates exactly as a registry of badges did (batch 3): `registry.ts` and

  // the wizard and RevealNudge read them unchanged — the single consumer line that did move
  // is the Features tab's category HEADING, which the batch-9 comment beside it said would
  // move when this registry did. A file whose SOURCE a test parses moves its guard with it:
  // `App.logtoast.test.ts` looked for the literal 'Logged QSO' inside the handler and now
  // follows the key, asserting exactly what it asserted before. And the Now-Bar's connector
  // pills were the batch's concatenation: six states each assembled from a stem, an optional
  // age clause and an optional host suffix, and each is ONE catalog sentence now — including
  // the two forms of "retrying", because "retrying" and "retrying, last event 4m ago" are
  // two statements and not a stem plus a tail.
  //
  // Nothing on a transmit path moved. App.tsx owns the halt_tx / TX-enable wiring and the
  // Esc bindings, PanelsMenu renders the ⊞ vocabulary the stop line is defined against, and
  // CockpitPaneFrame's header states the rule — but none of the three renders a stop
  // CONTROL: what moved here is menu entries, pane titles and the failure toasts those
  // handlers raise, no one of which any stop-line sweep can see. The Tempo header's drive

 * Audio, Headphone monitor, Satellite Doppler, Orbital elements and Rotator. Batch 16
 * (2026-08-19) took the Digital tab: the FT8/FT4 section's Logging Behavior, Decoder and
 * Station Housekeeping sub-groups, and the six weak-signal mode sections after it (JT65,
 * MSK144, Beacons — WSPR & FST4W, FST4, Q65, Quick-reply macros). Batch 17 (2026-08-19) took
 * the rest of the per-mode surface: the whole Phone tab, the whole CW tab (keyer, keying
 * ports, CW ID and the F-key macro editor with its role table and its two profile prompts),
 * and the Digital tab's RTTY, PSK, SSTV, APRS and Working Frequencies sections. Batch 22
 * (2026-08-19) took Transmit limits & sharing — the band-edge tones, the per-mode power caps,
 * the setup backup and the CAT-broker sharing block with its foreign-PTT permission, all of
 * them transmit POLICY and station plumbing rather than a control that keys or stops an over.
 * Putting the file on MIGRATED would report the tabs still to come; leaving it off entirely
 * would make every key those sections use look like an orphan.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE DIGITAL TAB IS THE OTHER REASON THIS FILE CANNOT GRADUATE YET, on the same
 * ruling that keeps `SetupHealth.tsx` below: the FT8/FT4 section's first two sub-groups,
 * "Transmit & Sequencing" and "Auto-CQ & Caller Selection", are the FT-mode TX / timing /
 * QSO-management surface. Their labels, hints and accessible names stay written in the panel
 * until the transmit-path batch moves them with the stop-line sweeps re-run — WSJT-X parity
 * there is a compatibility contract, and it cannot be verified in CI.
 *
 * `SetupHealth.tsx` is here for a DIFFERENT and much narrower reason, and it is the only kind
 * that may be added: every string in it is migrated except one CONTROL — Prove TX, which keys
 * a bounded tune carrier. Transmit-path controls and their accessible names move in their own
 * batch, with the stop-line sweeps re-run, so the button's label, its tooltip and the consent
 * prompt in front of it stay as written and the file cannot be clean yet. It graduates to
 * MIGRATED the moment that batch lands; nothing else is deferred in it.
 *
 * `AprsCockpit.tsx` (batch 14, 2026-08-19) is here for exactly that reason and no other:
 * every string in it is migrated except the TX On/Off ARM LATCH — its label and its two
 * tooltips. APRS renders no stop control at all (the latch only holds the queue, so it is on
 * no cockpit's stop-line census), but the latch is still a transmit-path control, and those
 * move with the sweeps. It graduates the moment that batch lands.
 *
 * `OperateQsoStrip.tsx` (batch 18, 2026-08-19) is here on the same narrow ruling, for FOUR
 * controls: STOP TX and TUNE — Operate's stop-line census, and Stop TX is the only control in
 * this cockpit that cuts an over in flight; ATU, which keys the rig's own tuning carrier
 * exactly as SetupHealth's Prove TX does; and the TX On/Off TOOLTIP, the wording that states
 * the abort semantics ("an FT over already in flight finishes"). Their labels and tooltips
 * stay written in the strip until the transmit-path batch moves them with the stop-line
 * sweeps re-run. Everything else in that file is migrated — the sequencer roles, the state
 * cap, the rig-divergence and narrow-filter chips, the now-sending readout, the free-text
 * form, the transmit-cycle and Skip Tx1 controls and the next-slot countdown — and the
 * mode-capability prose those controls SHARE ("this mode is receive-only", the beacon note)
 * moved with them: it describes the MODE, not the control it is hung on. Operate's third
 * census holder, Esc, is a window keydown with no string at all.
 *
 * `RttyCockpit.tsx`, `PskCockpit.tsx` and `SstvView.tsx` (batch 19, 2026-08-19) are here on
 * the same narrow ruling, and this batch is where it is stated in full: THE BATCH MOVES NO
 * CONTROL THAT STOPS A TRANSMISSION, whether or not a sweep looks for it. These three share
 * one stop-line shape, which is why they were migrated together — one reviewer, one mental
 * model. What stayed written, per file:
 *
 *   · RTTY — the dock's Esc/Stop macro (both spans and its tooltip; `stop-line.test.tsx`
 *     finds it by accessible name, /^esc\s*stop$/i), the auto-sequencer's Abort (census,
 *     conditionally rendered so no sweep sees it), the `stream` pane's "Auto on" toggle
 *     (its off-click is seq.abort() + Engine::rtty_stop() — a REAL stop, pane-resident,
 *     which is exactly why it is on no sweep's list), and the continuous-TX latch.
 *   · PSK — the same Esc/Stop macro and the same continuous-TX latch. No sequencer.
 *   · SSTV — the transmit dock's Stop (census; found by accessible name, /^stop$/i), the
 *     bar's own aria-label, which names the controls it holds, and the sentence Stop
 *     announces when it fires.
 *   · RTTY and PSK both — the TX-on-air pill's tooltip, which is the wording that states
 *     what Stop TX does to an over in flight (the batch-18 ruling on Operate's TX On/Off
 *     tooltip, verbatim).
 *   · JS8 (2026-09) — the TX-on-air pill's tooltip only (the batch-19 ruling, verbatim: the
 *     wording that states what Stop TX does to a frame in flight). Stop TX and Tune are
 *     drawn by CockpitHeader and deferred there.
 *
 * The TX-ENABLE LATCH is on all three cockpits' censuses and is drawn by `CockpitHeader`,
 * so it is deferred there rather than in any of these files. What DID move is everything
 * around them, senders included — the F-key macros, both compose bars and their Send, the
 * auto-sequencer's CQ/Answer, SSTV's Send and its whole composer — on the batch-18 ruling
 * that a control which STARTS a transmission is not what "transmit control" means here. So
 * did the refusal TOASTS those deferred controls raise: a toast is not a control and no
 * sweep can see one. All three graduate the moment the transmit-path batch lands.
 *
 * `PhoneCockpit.tsx` and `VoiceKeyer.tsx` (batch 21, 2026-08-19) are here on that same narrow
 * ruling — THE BATCH MOVES NO CONTROL THAT STOPS A TRANSMISSION, whether or not a sweep looks
 * for it — and Phone is the densest transmit surface in the tree, so what stayed written is
 * worth naming exactly:
 *
 *   · Phone — THE PTT ROW, whole. The button's four labels ARE the accessible name
 *     `stop-line.test.tsx` matches (/push to talk|on air — release to stop|tx locked|tx off —
 *     click to enable/i) and its three-armed tooltip is that control's description, naming
 *     which switch is down and the mic the operator talks on. The LOCK toggle beside it stays
 *     with them because it decides whether the window's Space keyup is a PTT release at all —
 *     the census's fourth holder — and the Field Day exchange chip stays because it shares the
 *     row. Stop TX and Tune, Phone's other two census holders, are drawn by `CockpitHeader`
 *     and are deferred there with the RTTY/SSTV latch.
 *   · The voice keyer — its ■ Stop, which really does end an over (stopVoice →
 *     Engine::stop_voice flushes the output ring and unkeys) and is pane-resident, so it is
 *     deliberately on no sweep's list; and the ■ Stop & save beside it, which ends the
 *     RECORDER rather than a transmission but shares that vocabulary, so the pair is reworded
 *     in one batch instead of drifting apart.
 *
 * What DID move includes everything those controls are surrounded by, the refusal TOASTS the
 * PTT handler raises included (the batch-19 ruling: a toast is not a control and no sweep can
 * see one), and the whole voice keyer besides its two buttons — a pane that STARTS a
 * transmission is not a transmit control (batch 18). Both files graduate the moment the
 * transmit-path batch lands. Deliberately NOT migrated and flagged in PhoneCockpit: the two ⊞
 * menu notes for the voice keyer (VOICE_KEYER_STOPS_ON_HIDE / VOICE_KEYER_UNDO_ENDS), because
 * the other four notes on that same menu live in `features/panelHost.ts`, `waterfall.ts` and
 * `TxMeters.tsx`, which this batch does not own — moving two of five would leave one menu
 * speaking two languages. They are named constants, so the guard cannot see them either way.
 *
 * `CockpitHeader.tsx` and `TopBar.tsx` (batch 22, 2026-08-19) are here on that same ruling, and
 * they are WHERE THE STOP LINE ACTUALLY RENDERS — which is why that batch was ordered last:
 *
 *   · The cockpit header draws FOUR transmit controls for SIX cockpits at once (Phone, CW,
 *     RTTY, PSK, SSTV and Operate), so one wrong word there is a six-cockpit regression that
 *     the name backstop — exact-word on vocabulary ids — cannot see. STOP TX (the `halt_tx` on
 *     every one of those censuses), TUNE (Phone, CW and Operate), the TX-ENABLE LATCH (a stop
 *     control in RTTY and SSTV, and the reason its branch keys on the slot flag rather than the
 *     arbiter) and ATU, which keys the rig's own tuning carrier exactly as SetupHealth's Prove
 *     TX does. Three of the four are matched by accessible name in `stop-line.test.tsx`
 *     (/^stop tx$/i, /^tune$|^tuning…$/i, /^▼ tx on$|^■ tx off$/i). The TX/RX pill's three
 *     plates stay with them: the pill is the PASSIVE rendering of that same latch, and the two
 *     must never read as different controls.
 *   · The top bar keeps its TX CLUSTER: TX On/Off, whose two tooltip arms state the abort
 *     semantics ("an FT over already in flight finishes" — the batch-18 ruling), TUNE, STOP TX,
 *     and the TX WATCHDOG chip, which is what the watchdog says once it has halted an over.
 *
 * Everything around them moved — the wheel-tune tooltips and the band-edge toast, the power
 * slider (batch 13: a configuration control on the transmit path is not a transmit control),
 * the CAT pill, the tier pills, the operator/Help/Field chips, the RX meter, the clock and
 * sync readouts, Hold Tx and the whole transmit-cycle group — and so did the mode-capability
 * prose the deferred controls SHARE ("this mode is receive-only"), which describes the MODE
 * and not the control it is hung on. Both files graduate the moment the transmit-path batch
 * lands.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS LIST IS A CONCESSION, NOT A HOME. A file belongs here only while a migration is
 * partial; when the last section moves it graduates to MIGRATED, and nothing else may be
 * added to it to dodge a failing check.
