# Station monitor development view

This foundation exposes station/radio/amplifier observations. It provides no remote
connection, TX, logging, tuning or amplifier command capability.

The shared React view accepts one `MonitorSource.read` capability. The native source
invokes only `get_remote_monitor_frame`, validates the v1 result and has no fixture
fallback. Rust copies a bounded observation without the full snapshot/logbook scan.
Native readers share a 500 ms cache and do not queue behind a busy engine. Stale
publication sequences cannot refresh the UI, and a hung read occupies just one slot.
Publication time is not a hardware measurement timestamp.

The native CAT link, reported mode and keyed flag currently remain unavailable.
The existing desktop mirrors carry no producer radio/read generation and can survive
a radio handoff; the default keyed flag also does not prove a PTT read occurred.
The monitor does not guess their source. Selected dial/mode, Nexus transmitter activity
and per-radio amplifier observations are available. Producer provenance is required
before enabling those three native readbacks.

## Preview

From `ui`, run `npm exec -- vite --config vite.monitor.config.ts`, then open
`http://127.0.0.1:5189/monitor.html`. The page explicitly identifies its example
station. Preview controls select Rust-generated scenarios, pause updates and enlarge
the display. The default desktop build does not include this entry or its fixtures.
Build the separate preview with `npm exec -- vite build --config vite.monitor.config.ts`.

## Native development window

Run Nexus with the normal Tauri development workflow. From the main window's developer
console, call the existing panel-opening command:

```js
window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke('open_panel_window', { panel: 'remoteMonitor' })
```

The `?panel=remoteMonitor` route is development-only. It reads that process's actual
station state while the main Nexus window remains available. A plain browser using
this native route reports unavailable data; it never substitutes example readings.

## Contract fixtures and checks

The `remote_monitor_fixtures` Rust example serializes actual engine observations after
synthetic amp status/miss inputs, plus explicit example CAT/keyed states for protocol
rendering coverage. Those CAT examples are not available native readbacks. It does
not connect to hardware. From the repository
root, regenerate and check the committed fixture with:

```sh
cargo run -p tempo-app --example remote_monitor_fixtures > ui/src/remote-monitor/fixtures.v1.json
cargo run -p tempo-app --example remote_monitor_fixtures -- --check
```

Run the repository's CI gates, including the standalone Tauri crate with `--features
radio`. Focused coverage lives in `crates/tempo-app/tests/remote_monitor.rs`, the Rust
monitor module/publisher tests and `ui/src/remote-monitor/*.test.*`. Browser geometry
and physical radio/amp tests provide different evidence; unit tests cannot establish
real-device layout, capture performance or RF stop behavior.
