          This used to disable Work and show "In a QSO with <call>" or "Transmitting" in place of
          the button. Both were wrong for what Pounce IS: a race against a pileup that has not
          formed yet. Whether to abandon the current contact and chase a new one is the
          operator's call to make in that moment, not something the app should refuse — and the
          reason text replaced the very control they were reaching for, so the alert became a
          notification you could not act on.
          Safe to allow: `work_spot_split` sets the mode then the dial, and the radio loop already
          defers a retune while a slot is actively transmitting (rigs reject VFO/mode changes
          mid-TX), so a click during our own over is applied at the next safe moment rather than
          keying across it. This removes a UI refusal, not a TX-path guard.
          Still notify-never-act ([[feedback-alerts-notify-never-act]]): Nexus does not move the
          radio on its own here — this is a button the operator presses. */}
