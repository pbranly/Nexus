// Standalone-window renderer: when the app is loaded at `?panel=<name>` (a torn-off
// window created by open_panel_window), render JUST that panel — chrome-less, with its
// own polling — against the same shared engine the main window uses. Multi-monitor
// tear-off: pop Connect / DXpeditions / the Operate cockpit / the Needed board onto
// separate displays so the operator stops toggling. Each detached window is its own
// independent client of the one shared Rust engine (snapshot at 300 ms; the Waterfall
// self-fetches its spectrum), and its action callbacks drive the same engine, so state
// stays consistent across every window.
//
// ⚠️ THIS FILE IS ON THE MIGRATED LIST (i18n/hardcoded-strings.test.ts). It is a router: the
// panels it mounts own their own prose. What is here is the states the router itself can be
// in — connecting, Field Day off, club sync off, and a panel name it does not know — plus the
// conversation-delete guard, which it deliberately raises in the SAME words as the main
// window (the two mirrors drifting apart is what put the guard here). The club-sync-off copy
// is the router's because it is about a panel that ISN'T mounted: it names the Settings route
// that would fill the board, and the board component never renders in that state.

/** A torn-off window is a SEPARATE JS REALM, not another branch of the main window's tree, so
 *  it needs its own confirm host: `confirmDialog` resolves through a module-level global, and in
 *  this document that global is `null` until something mounts one here. Without it the guarded
 *  action fails closed — it logs and answers "no" — which is how the ✕ on a conversation in this
 *  panel did nothing at all.
 *
 *  Mounted ONCE around the whole panel rather than beside each branch, because the body below
 *  returns from fifteen of them. Per-branch would reproduce the very bug this fixes: a host
 *  present in one tree and absent in another, failing silently in whichever branch someone
 *  forgets. The dialog portals (`RD.Portal`), so where this sits in the tree has no bearing on
 *  layout — only on whether it exists at all.
 *
 *  ⚠️ `<Toasts/>` CANNOT BE HOISTED TO SIT BESIDE IT, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. `zoom` lives
 *  on `.app` (styles.css) and the toast viewport sizes itself against `--vh-eff`, so a host
 *  outside the branch's `.app` renders at the wrong scale in a window the operator has zoomed.
 *  It has to be INSIDE that tree — which is why no branch writes its own
 *  `<div className="app detached">` any more and every one returns [`DetachedShell`], which
 *  carries the host. A new branch then gets one by construction and cannot omit it.
 *
 *  It WAS per-branch, and the Memories pop-out — one of the seven that never mounted one —
 *  turned that into data loss: its bulk delete asks "Delete 40 memories?", promises in the
 *  confirm body that "the toast that follows can undo it", deletes, and then the Undo it just
 *  promised does not exist, because `pushToast` resolves through a module-level bus and that
 *  document rendered nothing to receive it. */
