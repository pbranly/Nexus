// Panel VISIBILITY record — which panels a surface renders docked, which are torn off
// into their own window, and which the operator deleted. Pure (no JSX) so it unit-tests
// without React, and modelled on features/paneLayout.ts: the same coerce/load/save
// shape, defaults fill, unknown-id drop, and try/catch on storage.
//
// Deliberately SEPARATE from paneLayout. Placement decides WHICH pane occupies a grid
// cell; visibility decides WHETHER it renders. Because coercePlacement never sees a
// removal it cannot resurrect a panel you deleted — the hazard is unrepresentable
// rather than guarded — and the Classic/Roster presets stop fighting the operator for
// the same reason.
//
// TX-safety — THE STOP LINE (2026-08-03 operator ruling). This is the FIFTH wording; the four
// it replaces are kept below, each with the shipped code that falsified it, because that record
// is what stops a sixth attempt at a proxy. Every one of the four named a property of a PANE or
// of a CONTROL; the guarantee is a property of THE SCREEN THAT REMAINS, and that is the change.
//
// THE RULE (safety, enforced):
//
//   THE OPERATOR MUST NEVER BE UNABLE TO STOP A TRANSMISSION.
//
//   Mechanically, and this is the whole of it: IN EVERY COCKPIT, AT LEAST ONE CONTROL THAT
//   STOPS A TRANSMISSION RENDERS OUTSIDE EVERY ⊞-REMOVABLE PANE. Hide every id in that
//   cockpit's vocabulary — singly and all at once — and those controls are still in the
//   document and no more disabled than they were, because no vocabulary id can reach them.
//   Hiding one is UNREPRESENTABLE rather than guarded: no menu entry, no stored value and no
//   coercion rule reaches it, which is strictly stronger than a `removable: false` flag a bad
//   code path or a hand-edited blob could bypass.
//
//   THE CONTROLS THAT HOLD IT UP, re-verified entry by entry against shipped code 2026-08-03.
//   Each one names WHAT it stops, because "a control that stops a transmission" is not one
//   thing — `halt_tx` is universal and everything else has a scope — and because two entries
//   that read like stops turned out not to be:
//     · Phone  — PTT (the dock's .ph-ptt-row): release, or Lock-toggle-off, → setPtt(false) →
//                Engine::set_ptt, dropping the mic key it is holding, and only that.
//                · Stop TX (CockpitHeader) → haltTx → Engine::halt_tx — the universal kill:
//                slot/cw/rtty/sstv aborts armed, voice_tx dropped, every queue cleared, manual
//                and broker PTT released. · Tune (CockpitHeader) → Engine::set_tune(false),
//                which ends the tune carrier and only that. · the Space bar (window keyup) →
//                the same setPtt(false) as PTT-release, and ONLY while `lock` is off: both
//                Space handlers early-return in Lock (hands-free) mode.
//     · CW     — Stop TX (CockpitHeader) → stopCw + haltTx. · Tune → set_tune (the carrier
//                only). · Esc (window keydown) → the same abort() Stop TX calls.
//     · Operate— Stop TX (.op-btn.stop in the merged .cockpit-qso strip) → onHaltTx →
//                Engine::halt_tx. It is the ONLY control in this cockpit that cuts an over
//                already in flight. · Tune (same strip) → set_tune, the carrier only.
//                · Esc (window keydown, while the view is active) → the same halt.
//                TWO ENTRIES WERE REMOVED FROM THIS LIST 2026-08-03, both falsified by code:
//                  – TX On/Off is Engine::set_tx_enabled, which by the operator's own
//                    2026-07-31 ruling deliberately does NOT arm slot_tx_abort (engine.rs
//                    ~6826 and ~7106): "TX Off should disable TX for the next cycle, but allow
//                    any ongoing TX to complete." The button's own tooltip says exactly that.
//                    It stops the NEXT over, never the one on the air.
//                  – S&P is onSetMode('qso-monitor'): engine.rs ~5957 builds a fresh
//                    QsoStation::monitoring with running:false and clears tx_queue /
//                    broadcast_queue / own_tx. It arms no abort and does not touch tx_enabled.
//                    It ends the CQ RUN and drops what is queued behind the over still keying.
//     · RTTY   — Stop TX (CockpitHeader) → rttyStop + haltTx; carries no `disabled`, so it is
//                always operable. · the dock's Esc/Stop macro → the same pair,
//                `disabled={!sending}`, so it is live exactly while an over is on the air.
//                · the TX-enable latch (CockpitHeader) — a REAL stop here, unlike in Operate:
//                set_tx_enabled(false) clears rtty_queue and arms rtty_abort (engine.rs ~7120,
//                "a disarm must abort the over in flight AND drop the queue"), and
//                tempo-audio/service.rs ~3826 consumes it — FSK keyer cleared, output ring
//                flushed, rig.ptt(false) — whenever `now < rtty_busy_until`, i.e. an over is
//                actually keying. CockpitHeader draws it as a BUTTON only while
//                radio.transmitting is false; radio.transmitting is the SLOT-TX indicator
//                alone (Engine::set_transmitting is written by plan_beacon_tx, plan_tx,
//                commit_tx and halt_tx — the slot machinery and the universal kill, never the
//                RTTY path, which reports through rtty_sending instead), so the latch stays
//                a button through every RTTY over. · the auto-sequencer's Esc/Abort →
//                seq.abort() + Engine::rtty_stop(), rendered only inside
//                `{auto && seqState !== 'idle'}`.
//     · SSTV   — Stop (.sstv-tx-bar) → sstvStop, `disabled={!sending}`. · the TX-enable latch,
//                a real stop here for the same reason as RTTY: set_tx_enabled(false) drops
//                sstv_tx and arms sstv_abort (engine.rs ~7124), which service.rs ~4174 turns
//                into feed dropped + output flushed + unkey while an image is in flight.
//     · APRS   — a sixth cockpit with NO vocabulary at all: no ⊞ menu, nothing hideable, so
//                the rule holds there by construction. Say what that does and does not buy:
//                APRS renders NO stop control. Its TX On/Off is an arm latch —
//                set_tx_enabled does not clear aprs_tx_queue (only halt_tx does, engine.rs
//                ~6856) and arms no APRS abort; poll_aprs_tx merely HOLDS the queue while the
//                latch is down. Nothing on that screen cuts a beacon already keying.
//   The app-wide TopBar TX cluster is NOT a backstop for any of them: App hides it in Operate
//   (hideTxControls) and in Phone/CW/RTTY/SSTV/APRS (hideDigitalChrome). Every cockpit stands
//   on its own controls.
//
//   HOW THE SWEEPS LINE UP WITH THAT CENSUS. They do NOT match it one for one, and the claim
//   that they did — "each cockpit's sweep list is the same set, which is how this is checkable
//   in minutes" — was false for four of the five swept cockpits. What is true:
//     · Phone  — swept: PTT, Stop TX, Tune. Space is census-only: a window key handler has no
//                accessible name, and the sweep queries buttons BY name.
//     · CW     — swept: Stop TX, Tune. Esc is census-only, same reason.
//     · Operate— its guard's list is not a stop-control list at all. PROTECTED in
//                OperateCockpit.structure.test.tsx is the whole TX/sequencer surface of the
//                strip (Call CQ, S&P, TX On/Off, Tune, Stop TX, Hold Tx, TX auto, Skip Tx1),
//                asserted present inside .cockpit-qso with every id removed — the dock law,
//                which is a wider claim than this rule. Stop TX is the stop control in it;
//                Tune ends its own carrier; the rest are there for other reasons. Esc is
//                census-only.
//     · RTTY   — swept: Stop TX, the Esc/Stop macro, the TX-enable latch. The sequencer's
//                Abort is census-only: it renders only inside `{auto && seqState !== 'idle'}`
//                and the sweep's fixture is auto:false / seqState:'idle', so there is nothing
//                on screen to find.
//     · SSTV   — swept: Stop, the TX-enable latch. An exact match, and the only one.
//   A control that is KEYBOARD-ONLY or CONDITIONALLY RENDERED is outside both sweeps by
//   construction. What is checkable in minutes is not list equality: it is that every swept
//   list is a non-empty subset of its cockpit's census.
//
//   NOTHING ELSE ABOUT A PANE BEARS ON WHETHER IT MAY BE HIDDEN:
//     · A PANE MAY HOST A STOP CONTROL OF ITS OWN, and it goes away with the pane. TWO DO.
//       Phone's `voiceKeyer` hosts ■ Stop ("Abort playback (Esc)") → stopVoice →
//       Engine::stop_voice, whose flag makes the radio loop flush the output ring and unkey.
//       RTTY's `stream` hosts the "Auto on" toggle, whose off-click is rttySetAuto(false) →
//       seq.abort() + Engine::rtty_stop() (queue cleared, rtty_abort + slot_tx_abort → unkey)
//       — and `stream` is the ENTIRE RTTY vocabulary. Both are CONVENIENCES built on the
//       guarantee, never what holds it up, so hiding either pane is fine.
//     · A PANE MAY START A TRANSMISSION. SIX DO: Phone's voice keyer (F1–F6 → playVoiceMessage
//       keys the rig) and Operate's `txmsgs` (Tx6 = "Call CQ (Alt+6)" → startCq) plus its two
//       decode panes and two rosters (double-click → call_station_ctx, which ENABLES TX and
//       keys the current period). All hideable, correctly. Phone's and CW's `bandActivity` are
//       NOT senders, though they look like it — work_spot QSYs, splits and notes the call.
//     · A PANE'S HIDE MAY END SOMETHING IN FLIGHT. ONE DOES (the voice keyer). That earns a
//       note, not a refusal — see THE PRACTICE.
//
//   WHAT IS FORBIDDEN — exactly four things, all read off the census above:
//     1. Giving any control on a cockpit's list an id in a pane vocabulary. Equivalently:
//        MOVING one into a ⊞-removable pane, which is how it would acquire one.
//     2. Gating one on a pane id without moving it (`disabled={!shown('dsp')}`). Mounted and
//        dead is the same loss as gone — which is why the wiring sweep compares a
//        nothing-hidden BASELINE rather than `disabled === false`.
//     3. Shipping a cockpit whose ONLY stop control sits inside a ⊞-removable pane. None does.
//        RTTY is the closest — `stream` is its ENTIRE vocabulary — and it survives because
//        Stop TX, the Esc/Stop macro, the TX-enable latch and the sequencer's Abort all sit
//        outside it. Count what is LIVE, not what is listed: while an RTTY over is actually
//        keying OUTSIDE an auto sequence, THREE of those four are operable — Stop TX (never
//        disabled), the Esc/Stop macro (`disabled={!sending}`, so live exactly then) and the
//        latch (a button, because radio.transmitting is false) — and the sequencer's Abort is
//        not rendered at all.
//     4. Adding a PANE-RESIDENT stop control to a sweep's `stopControls`. That makes the sweep
//        demand its pane be unhideable — which is precisely how the first wording excluded the
//        pane it was written to admit. The keyer's ■ Stop and RTTY's Auto toggle stay off
//        those lists deliberately.
//
// THE PRACTICE (courtesy, not safety — and it must be read as courtesy):
//
//   If hiding a pane ENDS something already in flight, its ⊞ entry should say so before the
//   tick, because a stop the operator did not ask for reads as a dropout. That is why the
//   voice keyer's entry warns: its unmount aborts a message and discards a recording (the
//   second is destruction rather than safety, so it is named separately). A pane whose hide
//   ends nothing needs no warning — one the operator cannot act on teaches him to ignore
//   the next one. Computed in PhoneCockpit.keyerHide.test.tsx, which asks the WIRE which
//   hides stopped something and requires exactly those entries to carry a note. Courtesy is
//   worth computing; it is still not the safety rule, and nothing may be admitted or
//   refused on it.
//
// FOUR EARLIER WORDINGS, ALL FALSIFIED. Each was a PROXY for the guarantee rather than the
// guarantee, and a proxy has to be re-argued the moment something new turns up at the line:
//   1. "A pane that can only START a transmission may be hidden; anything that can STOP one
//      may never be." — EXCLUDED THE VOICE KEYER, the pane it was written to admit, because
//      the keyer hosts a ■ Stop button of its own. A pane's own Stop is a convenience; the
//      operator's last resort is the dock.
//   2. "A pane that MAY BE HIDDEN has a hide path that is itself a stop — unmounting it ends
//      what it started — and its ⊞ entry says so." — By its own words it bound EVERY
//      hideable pane, and only the voice keyer's hide is a stop, so it forbade 23 of the 24
//      entries in ALL_PANEL_VOCABULARIES: every pane that ships except the one it was
//      written for. The first defect, pointing the other way.
//   3. "A pane THAT CAN START A TRANSMISSION may be hidden only if its hide path is itself a
//      stop AND its ⊞ entry says so." — VIOLATED BY SHIPPED CODE. Operate's `txmsgs` hosts
//      Tx1–Tx6, and Tx6 is "Call CQ (Alt+6)" → `startCq`: it can start a transmission, it is
//      hideable, its hide stops nothing and says nothing, and it has shipped that way for
//      months. Operate's bandActivity/rxfreq/callRoster/stations are four more of the same.
//   4. "Every control that STOPS a transmission — PTT, Stop TX, Tune, the TX-enable latch,
//      abort — has NO id in any pane vocabulary." — FALSIFIED BY SHIPPED CODE TWICE, the
//      first time by wording 1's own counter-example. The voice keyer's ■ Stop → stopVoice →
//      Engine::stop_voice (flush the output ring, unkey) is a control that stops a
//      transmission, and it sits inside `voiceKeyer`, which HAS an id — so ticking that entry
//      hides a stop control. RTTY's `stream` hosts a second, unnoticed until this pass: the
//      "Auto on" toggle, off-click → rttySetAuto(false) → seq.abort() + Engine::rtty_stop()
//      (queue cleared, rtty_abort + slot_tx_abort → unkey), and `stream` is the entire RTTY
//      vocabulary. Read strictly, the wording forbids both of those entries; read loosely, as
//      "no id is NAMED for a stop control", it is just the name backstop — a guard, not the
//      rule.
//   THE DIAGNOSIS behind 1–3: "the hide is itself a stop" was never a safety requirement. It
//   is a property the voice keyer HAPPENS to have — its unmount cleanup calls stopVoice —
//   generalised into a rule. Hide Operate's Tx messages mid-CQ and the over continues; Stop TX
//   is still in the QSO strip, so the operator can still stop it.
//   THE DIAGNOSIS behind 4: it protected CONTROLS, one at a time, when the guarantee is about
//   THE OPERATOR HAVING ONE LEFT. A pane's own stop may go away with the pane; the ones
//   outside every pane may not. THE GUARANTEE HOLDS EITHER WAY — all it ever needed was that a
//   stop control still be REACHABLE with everything hidden, which is the rule above.
//
// WHAT HAS NO ID HERE, and therefore cannot be hidden: the dial, the band/mode pickers, the
// Rx/Tx offset spinners, the QSO strip's TX On / Tune / Stop TX / Hold Tx, Phone's PTT row,
// CW's F-key macros and send bar, RTTY's header Stop TX + TX latch and both dock aborts,
// SSTV's Send/Stop bar. Recounted 2026-08-16: 28 entries across five vocabularies (20
// distinct ids), of which six can start a transmission, TWO host a stop control of their own
// (voiceKeyer, stream) and exactly one — voiceKeyer — has a hide that stops anything. The
// four added that day are the spectrum strips (SCOPE_PANEL_ID) — Phone, CW, RTTY and SSTV
// each gained the entry Operate has had since 0.15.0 — and they move none of those three
// counts: a strip sends nothing, hosts no stop and ends nothing on its way out. Recount
// from ALL_PANEL_VOCABULARIES at the foot of this file; do not trust the numbers, they are
// here to be checked.
//
// ENFORCEMENT — two guards, and neither is the rule on its own:
//   · the NAME backstop (panelState.test.ts, driven by ALL_PANEL_VOCABULARIES at the foot
//     of this file) — no vocabulary may contain an id NAMED for a stop control. It reads
//     names, never wiring: a stop control gated on an id called `dsp` walks past it.
//   · the RENDERED sweep in components/stop-line.test.tsx (Phone/CW/RTTY/SSTV, with the
//     REAL CockpitHeader and the props App passes) — with EVERY id in that cockpit's
//     vocabulary removed, singly and all at once, every stop control ON THAT COCKPIT'S LIST
//     must still be in the document, found by its accessible name and no more disabled than
//     it was. The list is the OUTSIDE-EVERY-PANE set and only that: a pane-resident stop (the
//     keyer's ■ Stop, RTTY's Auto toggle) is deliberately absent, because listing one would
//     make the sweep demand its pane be unhideable — forbidden item 4 above. Operate is
//     swept in OperateCockpit.structure.test.tsx, and that one is PRESENCE-ONLY: every id
//     removed at once, no baseline, no `disabled` comparison, no one-id-at-a-time pass. It
//     is NOT the four-cockpit sweep's equivalent. Both read wiring, never names: a dead
//     `ptt` id that gates nothing walks past THEM.
//
// WHAT THE GUARDS DO NOT PROVE — the full list is in the cockpit-panes.css header and
// CLAUDE.md, and it is short enough to carry the headline here: NEITHER SWEEP CAN SEE A STOP
// CONTROL THAT IS PRESENT, ENABLED AND INERT (an `onClick={() => {}}` on Stop TX passes the
// whole suite); the name backstop is EXACT-WORD, so `txStop`/`pttRow`/`killTx` walk past it;
// the PRACTICE note-pairing is computed for Phone only; Operate's sweep is presence-only and
// is not the equivalent of the four-cockpit one; NO SWEEP CAN SEE A KEYBOARD-ONLY OR
// CONDITIONALLY RENDERED STOP (Phone's Space, CW's and Operate's Esc, RTTY's sequencer Abort
// are all census-only for that reason); and that a NEWLY ADDED stop control reached its
// cockpit's sweep list is a human step, named in each sweep.

 *
 * ONE id across Phone/CW/RTTY/SSTV, because it is one thing wherever it renders: a
 * spectrum display the operator either wants or does not. What it HOLDS differs per
 * cockpit and never matters here — Operate's strip swaps FastGraph in for MSK144, Phone's
 * and CW's is the rig scope, RTTY's and SSTV's the band waterfall. The ⊞ label is the
 * cockpit's own word for it ("Scope" in Phone/CW, "Waterfall" in RTTY/SSTV); the id is not.
 *
 * WHY IT MAY BE HIDDEN, under THE STOP LINE and not around it: verified per cockpit
 * 2026-08-16, the strip hosts NO control that stops a transmission in any of them. Its
 * whole control surface is display — palette, floor/zero, resolution window, 2D/3D, pause
 * (a RENDER pause, not a TX one), scroll direction, Operate's pop-out — plus click-to-tune,
 * which moves the dial and keys nothing. Every stop control stays where it was: Stop TX and
 * Tune in the CockpitHeader, Phone's PTT in the dock, RTTY's Esc/Stop macro and the
 * TX-enable latch, SSTV's `.sstv-tx-bar` Stop. Hiding the strip is therefore
 * unrepresentable-as-harmful in the same way every other entry is, and the four-cockpit
 * wiring sweep in components/stop-line.test.tsx now hides this id too (it is driven off
 * these arrays), which is where that claim is COMPUTED rather than asserted here.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A SENDER AND ITS HIDE ENDS NOTHING, so it carries no ⊞ note — THE PRACTICE
 * requires a note of a hide that stops something in flight, and one the operator cannot act
 * on teaches him to ignore the next.
 *
 * OPERATE IS NOT ON THIS LIST and keeps its own `waterfall` id. That entry shipped in
 * 0.15.0, already hides the strip, and carries two things `scope` does not: the 'popped'
 * pop-out state and migrateWaterfallDetached, which keys on the literal id. Renaming it
 * would drop every stored preference and break the re-dock; giving RTTY/SSTV the name
 * `waterfall` instead would pull them into that one-time migration and make which cockpit
 * consumed its marker an ordering accident. Two names, one behaviour, and the reason is
 * storage compatibility rather than taste.

 *  is not one either, for a different reason — it holds a QSO the operator is part-way
 *  through typing, and a tick that drops unsaved work is its own kind of harm.
 *
 *  THE SCOPE ITSELF IS ONE, since 2026-08-16 (see SCOPE_PANEL_ID). An earlier version of
 *  this note grouped it with the header and the PTT row as "NOT panels: each hosts a way to
 *  STOP a transmission" — which was FALSE OF THE SCOPE and is the reason it is called out
 *  here rather than quietly moved. PhoneScope hosts a floor slider, a resolution/2D-3D/pause
 *  trio and click-to-tune; not one of them stops anything. The header and the PTT row are
 *  what that sentence was ever true of, and they are still outside the menu's reach.
 *  `rigscope` remains a SEPARATE and differently-scoped entry: it is the pane of controls
 *  that command the RADIO's own panadapter, and it lives in the region under the strip.
 *
 *  `voiceKeyer` IS one, since 2026-08-03. Nothing about it needed admitting: it transmits,
 *  and under the rule that has no bearing on whether it may be hidden — Stop TX and PTT are
 *  not panels, so the operator's last resort is out of the menu's reach whatever he ticks.
 *  Its own ■ Stop → stopVoice IS a control that stops a transmission, and it goes away with
 *  the pane: a convenience built on the guarantee, never what holds it up. The first wording
 *  turned on that button and thereby forbade the pane it was written to admit; the fourth
 *  tripped over it from the other side (see the header). RTTY's `stream` is the only other
 *  pane in the app like it.
 *
 *  Its entry DOES carry a warning, and that is THE PRACTICE, not the rule: VoiceKeyer's
 *  unmount cleanup calls stopVoice, so unticking it ends a message in flight, and the same
 *  cleanup discards a recording in progress. Both are named before the tick because a stop
 *  the operator did not ask for reads as a dropout. A hideable sender whose hide ends
