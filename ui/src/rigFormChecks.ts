/**
 * Pre-save checks for the rig form.
 *
 * The form has exactly one check — the callsign — so every way of getting the RADIO wrong saves
 * silently and then behaves like broken hardware: no CAT, no keying, or a rig that answers nothing
 * and looks dead. Each check below is a mistake that is easy to make, invisible at save time, and
 * expensive to diagnose afterwards, because the symptom appears far from the cause.
 *
 * Pure on purpose. Everything is decided from the form plus facts passed in, so it is
 * unit-testable without hardware, a running app, or a rig.
 *
 * An `error` stops the save; a `warning` is stated and the operator proceeds. The split matters:
 * an operator with an unusual-but-correct setup must never be locked out of their own
 * configuration by a heuristic, so only things that CANNOT be right block.
 *
 * TWO CHECKS ARE DECIDED FROM USB TOPOLOGY, and they carry an extra rule. Topology is only
 * readable on some platforms (macOS today), and even there the IO registry can answer nothing —
 * so both are DIAGNOSTIC and both are WARNINGS: they say nothing when the facts are absent or
 * unproven, and neither may ever be the reason a save is refused. A caller that passes no
 * topology gets exactly the checks that existed before it, unchanged. The bias is deliberate:
 * a topology finding that turns out to be wrong on somebody's station must cost them a sentence,
 * never their configuration.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS FILE IS ON THE MIGRATED LIST (i18n/hardcoded-strings.test.ts). Every message comes
 * from the catalog. What does NOT: the port name itself, which is interpolated as the operator's
 * own `COM5` / `/dev/cu.usbserial-A` — a device name, never translated and never reformatted.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE — two ports collide (two profiles on one serial port). The
 * backend already decides that, in `settings::serial_port_conflicts`, and App.tsx already puts
 * its verdict in the status lane as `radioConfigWarning`. That rule carries four qualifiers a
 * form-side copy loses on sight — the other profile must be `enabled`, have `rig_model > 0`, be
 * on `rig_conn == "serial"` and have a non-empty port, and the comparison is case-insensitive —
 * so the copy fires on disabled profiles and misses `COM3` vs `com3`. It is also a WARNING
 * there, correctly: a station that swaps one cable between two rigs has both profiles on one
 * port on purpose and must still be able to save. One rule, one place; this file does not get a
 * second opinion on it.
