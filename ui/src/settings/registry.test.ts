// Guards for the settings registry.
//
// The registry is only worth having if it is PROVEN to describe the real panel. Four reorgs
// decayed because placement lived in the shape of the JSX and nothing checked it; a registry
// that is allowed to drift from the panel is the same failure with an extra file. So:
//
//   1. EXHAUSTIVENESS — every `<legend>` the panel renders is a registered section, and every
//      registered section is rendered. Neither direction alone is enough: the first catches a
//      new section added without a registry entry (the ~3-fields-a-day path), the second
//      catches a registry entry left behind when a section is deleted or renamed.
//   2. THE ADVANCED RULE — a setting may hide in a collapsed disclosure only if it is not
//      needed in the first hour. Issue #62 was an operator who could not find a toggle that
//      already shipped, inside the collapsed Advanced group. The rule was written down in the
//      0.17 plan and never enforced by anything, so it did not hold.
//   3. DENSITY — no tab may grow past a ceiling without someone deciding to raise it. This is
//      the guard the previous four reorgs lacked entirely: they each fixed the symptom (tab
//      count) while the thing operators actually scan (sections per page) grew monotonically.
//
// These run in node — the registry is pure data, so none of this needs a DOM.
