/** Settings ▸ Connections — what a connector row actually MEANS.
 *
 * The panel used to paint its dot straight off `stored`, a keychain read. That answered
 * "does a secret exist", not "are my QSOs getting out", so a revoked ClubLog app-password
 * or a rotated QRZ Logbook key stayed green indefinitely — the secret had not stopped
 * existing, which was the only thing being checked.
 *
 * The derivation lives here rather than as inline ternaries in SettingsPanel.tsx for the
 * same reason `registry.ts` does: it is a judgement call with an order that matters, and a
 * judgement call belongs somewhere it can be tested. Pure data + pure helpers — no React,
 * no api, no storage.

 *  - `paused`  — a session kill-switch is holding every upload back (red)
 *  - `failing` — the last thing that happened was a failure (red)
 *  - `off`     — it uploads, but the operator turned auto-upload off (grey)
 *  - `working` — an upload got through, and nothing has failed since (green)
 *  - `lookup`  — lookup-only; it never uploads, so it cannot be behind (grey)

/** Which state a row is in. The ORDER is the design:
 *
 *  1. No credential beats everything — there is nothing to be healthy about.
 *  2. A kill-switch beats a stale success: while it is set, nothing is being sent at all.
 *  3. A failure not OLDER than the last success beats that success. ⚠️ Not older, not newer:
 *     the stamps are whole seconds, so a success and a failure inside one second compare
 *     equal, and a strict `>` rendered that tie GREEN — and green stayed until the next
 *     failure. The tie is reachable (the auto-push worker loops with no spacing between legs
 *     and a LAN Cloudlog answers in milliseconds) and it resolves red, because a wrong
 *     `failing` is corrected by the next successful push while a wrong `working` is a
 *     connector claiming to work at the moment it does not.
 *  4. Deliberately off beats "never verified" — an operator who turned it off is not
 *     looking at a problem.
 *  5. A success with nothing failing since is working.
 *  6. Lookup-only connectors never upload, so there is nothing to have gone wrong.
 *  7. Everything left is stored, on, and has never been exercised. ⚠️ THIS is the case the
 *     panel used to render GREEN, and it is the whole point of the change: honest
 *     degradation. "No news" is not good news; it is no news.
