# Nexus frequency plan

Nexus uses a **new waveform** (TempoFast / TempoDeep — the Tempo chat layer protocols), so it must **not** transmit on the
established FT8 / FT4 / JS8 / WSPR / PSK watering holes — it would QRM them and
they would QRM it. Nexus therefore ships its own **calling frequencies**, chosen
to sit clear of every existing narrowband convention while staying inside the
operator's legal sub-band.

> **These are proposed, editable defaults — not regulatory channels.** They are a
> starting point to coordinate with the digital community. In the app you can pick
> any band with one tap **or enter any frequency manually** (TopBar and Settings).
> New modes that squatted on existing watering holes caused real friction, so
> community buy-in matters. Nexus deliberately avoids every established watering hole.

## How the frequencies were chosen

- **HF — "upper shoulder of the digital cluster."** On each band the dense block
  (FT8 → JT65 → JS8 → FT4) runs from the FT8 dial up a few kHz. Nexus sits just
  **above** that block and **below** the fragile ~200 Hz WSPR window, inside the
  IARU narrowband-modes segment. This is exactly how JS8 was sited relative to
  FT8 — Nexus takes the next clear notch up.
- **VHF/UHF — two tracks.** A **USB weak-signal** calling frequency in the
  bottom-of-band weak-signal segment (for all-mode rigs, like VHF FT8), **and** an
  **FM-simplex data** channel in a band-plan digital/experimental segment (for the
  FM HTs most off-grid operators carry). Both are offset well clear of the FM
  national simplex calling frequencies (146.520 / 446.000 / 223.500–223.540), APRS,
  satellite sub-bands, and repeater splits.

## Verification

Nexus is USB with ~1500 Hz audio, so the **emitted RF sits ~1.5 kHz above the
dial**. Every frequency below was checked, on the *emission*, to be:

1. **Inside US General-class privileges** — the General data sub-bands on
   80–10 m, full privileges on 160 m / 6 m, and band-wide data above 50 MHz. None
   land in Extra-only slivers or phone segments. (General is the reference; Extra
   is a superset. There is no Technician HF data access — 10 m and 6 m are the
   Technician-accessible Nexus frequencies.)
2. **Clear of CW** — above the CW portion of each band and clear of the QRP / SKCC
   / FISTS CW calling frequencies.

## HF — USB

All dials are USB suppressed-carrier; the **emission sits ~1.5 kHz higher**, and
every gap below is measured to that *emission*. General data sub-band edges shown
where relevant.

| Band | Nexus dial (MHz) | Nearest watering holes / edges (gap to emission) | Notes |

## Caveats

- **Proposed + editable.** Coordinate with the community before treating any of
  these as "the" Nexus frequency; the app lets you override any dial.
- **Dial vs emission.** All HF/USB values are suppressed-carrier *dial*
  frequencies; the emission is ~1.5 kHz higher. On tight bands (160 m, 17 m, 12 m)
  verify your audio offset keeps the signal inside the segment and below the band
  edge.
- **Region differences.** Picks are framed for the **US (FCC/ARRL)**. IARU R1/R3
  band plans differ — notably 40 m / 80 m digital edges and the VHF SSB calls
  (144.300 vs 144.200, 432.200 vs 432.100) and APRS (144.800 vs 144.390). R1/R3
  operators must re-vet against their national plan.
- **FM channels are segments, not assignments.** The exact 20 kHz slot within the
  2 m experimental (145.5x) and 1.25 m digital (223.5x) segments — and especially
  the 70 cm 445.95 pick — should be brought to a regional frequency coordinator.
- **Omitted:** 60 m (channelized — no clean slot; FT8 uses 5.357 in the worldwide
  5351.5–5366.5 kHz segment and, in the US since 13 Feb 2026, 5.3715 on the 100 W
  channel) and 33 cm / 23 cm (sparse; easy to add later).
- **Cramped bands.** 17 m and 12 m have data windows only ~42 / 40 kHz wide with
  FT8/FT4/JS8/WSPR packed at the top, so there is **no clean ≥2–3 kHz notch**: the
  Nexus dials (18.0955 / 24.9115) sit in the small gap below the FT8 cluster and
  above the CW calling spots (QRP CW 18.096, SKCC 24.910), leaving only ~1–3 kHz on
  one side. Use **TempoDeep's ~50 Hz** variant on these bands — a ~150 Hz TempoFast signal does
  not fit cleanly — and listen before transmitting.

## Changing frequency in Nexus

- **Band selector** (TopBar and Settings): grouped HF / VHF / UHF channel list —
  one tap jumps the rig to that band's Nexus frequency and mode.
- **Manual entry:** type any dial frequency (MHz) and pick USB/FM; Nexus retunes
  the rig live (via `rigctld`/CAT) and labels the band automatically.
