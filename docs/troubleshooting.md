# Troubleshooting

The field guide to the problems that actually come up: CAT, audio, decoding, and
the UI. Most issues are one of four things — a CAT/driver mismatch, the wrong
audio device, a clock that's off, or a credential problem. Work top to bottom.

For subsystem depth beyond what's here — the full CAT verb set, PTT methods, the
rig-mode policy, or connector specifics — the [Rig and Audio Setup](manual/Rig-and-Audio-Setup.md)
and [Integrations](manual/Integrations.md) guides go deeper on their own areas.

## Installing

### The installer sits quiet for a few minutes

Normal — it carries the complete WebView2 runtime (~209 MB) and installs it for you. There is
**nothing to download or install by hand**: no WebView2, no Hamlib, no drivers for most rigs.
Let it finish.

### Windows says "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen)

Expected — the installers are unsigned. Click **More info → Run anyway**.

### The window comes up blank — or Nexus doesn't start at all

Nexus draws its whole interface in the **Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime**, so when that
runtime is missing, damaged, or has a corrupt cache, you get a blank window — or, worse,
nothing at all: no window, no error, no sign the program ran.

Re-running the installer is worth one try, but it is **not** the fix for the two commonest
causes, and if you have already tried it, skip straight past it.

Work down this list:

1. **Check your antivirus quarantine.** The installers are unsigned (see SmartScreen,
   above), and some scanners react to that by silently deleting parts of Nexus *after* a
   successful install. Open **Windows Security ▸ Virus & threat protection ▸ Protection
   history** — third-party scanners have their own equivalent — and look for a Nexus entry.
   **Restore** it, then add an **exclusion** for the install folder
   (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Nexus`) so it does not happen again on the next update.

2. **Repair the WebView2 runtime.** Open **Settings ▸ Apps ▸ Installed apps**, find
   **Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime**, and choose **Modify ▸ Repair**. Start Nexus again
   when it finishes. If it is not in the list at all, it is not installed — run the Nexus
   installer, which carries the full runtime.

3. **Let Nexus repair its own cache.** Current builds detect this failure themselves: Nexus
   shows a dialog naming WebView2 instead of exiting silently, and on the first failure it
   sets the WebView2 cache folder aside and retries once, which clears a corrupt profile
   with nothing for you to do. If you get that dialog, its text tells you where you are.
   **Older builds exit silently** — so if launching does nothing at all, no window and no
   message, you are on one of those, and updating is worth doing before anything else.

4. **Read the diagnostic log** (below). It records each startup step as it happens, so the
   last line in the file is the point Nexus got to before it stopped.

### The diagnostic log — what to send us when it won't start

Nexus keeps a plain-text record of what it did, in its data folder:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Nexus\nexus-diag.log` |
| **macOS and Linux** | `~/.local/share/Nexus/nexus-diag.log` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Nexus/`) |

It sits beside `ALL.TXT` and the crash report `nexus-crash.txt`, so there is one folder to
look in. If Nexus does start, **Settings ▸ Logging & Connectors ▸ Write ALL.TXT decode log ▸
Reveal in folder** opens that folder for you.

It holds timestamped, human-readable lines for the startup steps, the CAT and audio device
open and any failure, updater checks, panics, and webview failures — not routine decoding
traffic. When a launch fails, **the last line is the answer**: it names the last step that
completed.

Three things worth knowing:

- **It cannot grow without bound.** There are two files at most — the active
  `nexus-diag.log` and one previous generation, `nexus-diag.1.log` — about 8 MB in total,
  worst case. When the active file fills, it is simply renamed aside and a fresh one
  started, so a large log never slows a launch down.
- **It is safe to attach to a public bug report.** Passwords, API keys and tokens are
  masked before anything is written to it. It is designed to be sent to a stranger.
- **There is no way to turn it off, and that is deliberate.** The runs worth diagnosing are
  the ones that die during startup, before any setting has been read — a log you could
  switch off would be missing on exactly the launch you needed it for, and the switch itself
  would have to live in a file that launch may never have reached. The size cap and the
  masking above are what make "always on" reasonable rather than rude.

### More detail in the log, and the `--debug` that does not exist

When we ask you to "turn logging up", this is the switch: **Settings ▸ Logging & Connectors ▸
Integrations & Feeds ▸ Local APIs & Loggers ▸ "Extra detail in the diagnostic log"**. It sits
below the ALL.TXT row and below the diagnostic-log entry itself, a fair way down that page. It
takes effect immediately — no restart — and it adds each transmission, the per-period decode
counts and the CAT traffic. The log records at the top when it was on.

**Nexus takes exactly one command-line argument, `--profile <name>`**, which picks a separate
config directory so two instances can run side by side (`NEXUS_PROFILE` does the same job as an
environment variable). There is **no `--debug` flag**, and there is not going to be one: the
switch above already applies live, which is the better instrument for a fault that is happening
right now, and the case a launch flag would uniquely cover — a crash before Settings is
reachable — is already covered by the base log, which is always on from the first moments of
startup.

## CAT / rig control

### The radio isn't found by Detect

**Detect my radio** (Settings ▸ Radio ▸ Rig & CAT, and in the wizard) enumerates USB
devices and scans for FlexRadios on the LAN. If it finds nothing:

- Make sure the rig is **plugged in and powered on**, then click Detect again.
- USB bridge-chip cables need a **driver**. If Windows is missing it, Detect names
  the chip (CP210x, FTDI, CH340, or Prolific) and shows the vendor download link.
  Install it, then hit **Refresh** to re-scan. Without the driver the COM port
  never appears at all.
- A FlexRadio must be reachable on the **same network** as the PC for LAN
  discovery to see it. Discovery listens for the radio's own broadcast, which
  does not cross a router — a Flex you reach over SmartLink or a port-forward
  will not appear.
- **On macOS: local-network permission.** Every LAN scan leaves the Mac, and
  macOS 15 gates that behind **Local Network** privacy. Nexus does not yet ship
  the usage string that asks for it, so you may never see a prompt — and a
  denial looks exactly like an empty network: "No radios found", no error.
  Check **System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Local Network**, enable
  **Nexus** if it is listed, and relaunch.

### Driver hint: USB bridge chip detected but the rig won't open

Nexus recognizes the four common USB-serial bridge chips by vendor ID and, on
Windows, links the driver each one needs:

| Chip | Windows |
|---|---|
| Silicon Labs CP210x | Driver download required |
| FTDI | Driver download required |
| WCH CH340 | Driver download required |
| Prolific PL2303 | Driver download required |

Native-USB rigs (IC-705, IC-7300, and similar that report a model name in the USB
descriptor) need no driver and match their Hamlib model automatically. After
installing any driver, click **Refresh** in Settings.

On **macOS and Linux** the common bridge chips (CP210x, FTDI) are driven in-kernel —
there is no driver to install; the port appears as `/dev/cu.*` (macOS) or
`/dev/ttyUSB*` (Linux) as soon as the cable is plugged in.

### Test CAT fails or times out

**Test CAT** saves your settings, starts (or restarts) the CAT daemon `rigctld`
(bundled on every platform since 1.9.0), waits ~1.3 s, and reads the dial frequency. A real frequency back
(e.g. `14.074 MHz`) means CAT is healthy. A failure is almost always one of:

1. **Wrong model** — confirm the Hamlib model. If your rig connected through a
   generic bridge cable, Detect leaves the model blank on purpose; pick it from
   the dropdown (for an unlisted rig, run an external `rigctld` and connect as
   NET rigctl, model 2).
2. **Wrong COM port** — pick the right port and **Refresh**. Make sure nothing
   else holds it: WSJT-X, another logger, or a leftover Nexus/`rigctld` from a
   previous session.
3. **Wrong baud rate** — match the rig's CAT baud exactly (default 38400; common
   values 9600 / 19200 / 38400 / 57600).
4. **Port conflict** — `rigctld` binds `4532` by default; change **rigctld Port**
   if something else is on it.
5. **A slow rig or busy port** — the probe waits a fixed ~1.3 s. On a slow machine
   or a congested serial port that can be too short; just run **Test CAT** again,
   or start Nexus with the rig already powered on. Slow serial rigs are otherwise
   handled fine once connected.

<!-- TODO: capture screenshot — Settings ▸ Radio ▸ Rig & CAT after a successful Test CAT, showing the read-back dial frequency -->

### The rig won't change mode when I switch sections (FTDX10-class)

Nexus commands the rig's mode over CAT every time you enter a section — the DATA
submode (`PKTUSB` / `PKTLSB`) for digital, `CW` for the keyer, the band-correct
sideband for phone — so you shouldn't have to set mode by hand. On some rigs
(the Yaesu FTDX10 is the one people ask about) the mode can appear "stuck." Check:

- **Another app is fighting for CAT.** If WSJT-X, a logger, or a stray `rigctld`
  also owns the port, the two will trade mode commands. Close the other app, or
  share the radio through the [CAT broker](manual/Rig-and-Audio-Setup.md#the-cat-broker)
  instead of opening the port twice.
- **The rig rejects the DATA submode.** A few older rigs don't implement
  `PKTUSB`; plain USB will pass FT8 audio, but turn off the rig's RX DSP (NR, NB,
  APF) so it doesn't chew up decodes.

One thing to know: Nexus **commands** mode but does not read it back over CAT, so
the sideband badge in the cockpit is computed from the dial frequency, not
confirmed from the rig. If another program left the rig in the wrong mode, Nexus
corrects it on the next section entry rather than the moment it happens.

### FlexRadio — CAT won't connect / an address error

Point Flex CAT at the **SmartSDR CAT app running on the same PC**, not at the
radio itself. Detecting a Flex in the wizard sets this for you:

- Connection: **Network**, address **`127.0.0.1:5002`** (SmartSDR CAT, slice A;
  slice B uses `60001`, C `60002`).
- Audio: SmartSDR's **DAX** virtual devices — the **⚡ Pair DAX audio** button
  wires them in.

If you instead aim CAT at the radio's own IP (or its `:4992` port), Windows
typically returns a *"the requested address is not valid in its context"*
(WinError 10049) type failure, because that isn't the CAT endpoint your PC can
open. The rule generalizes to any network rig: the CAT address has to be a `host:port`
your PC can actually open a TCP connection to, with `rigctld` (or SmartSDR CAT)
listening there. SmartSDR CAT must be running for the Flex path to work.

`127.0.0.1:5002` assumes SmartSDR CAT is on the **same machine as Nexus**. If it
runs on another PC — the normal arrangement when Nexus is on a Mac — use that
PC's LAN address (`192.168.1.20:5002`) and its DAX devices.

**On macOS**, a CAT address out on the LAN is subject to the **Local Network**
permission, and a denial produces the same "nothing answered" message as a wrong
address. If the same address works from another machine, check
**System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Local Network** and relaunch. See the
[FlexRadio guide](rigs/flexradio.md#macos) for the whole picture — including why
the *native* panadapter/DAX toggles cannot work through SmartLink or NAT at all.

## Audio

### Picking the right devices

In **Settings ▸ Radio ▸ Audio** there are two device pickers, and getting them right fixes
most audio problems:

- **Input (RX)** — the sound card carrying your rig's *received* audio. This is
  what Nexus decodes.
- **Output (TX)** — the sound card feeding audio *into* the rig's data/mic input.
  This is what Nexus transmits.

For a typical USB interface (SignaLink, DigiRig, the codec inside an IC-7300) the
same device appears for both — **Detect** fills them from the USB product string,
or pick the same device by hand. **Refresh** re-scans after you plug something in.

### FlexRadio — pair DAX

Flex users route audio through SmartSDR's **DAX** virtual devices, not a physical
sound card. Use **⚡ Pair DAX audio** in the wizard (or select the DAX devices
manually in Settings ▸ Radio ▸ Audio).

### My recording captured the band, not my voice

This is usually the audio input pointing at the wrong source, and it's worth
understanding *why*:

- **Voice-keyer recordings** capture from the audio **input** device. If that's
  set to your rig's receive audio (as it must be for decoding), an in-app
  recording will contain the *received band*, not you. Record your keyer messages
  with your **microphone** selected as the input, or record the WAV in another app
  and import it.
- **QSO recording** in the Phone cockpit streams the **received** audio to a WAV
  by design — it's meant to capture the contact you're hearing, not your transmit.

**Headphone monitor** (Settings ▸ Radio ▸ Audio ▸ Headphone monitor): plays the exact
audio the decoder hears — for level/RFI diagnosis and listening to the band.
If you enable it and hear nothing, check the audio-status line: Nexus refuses
to open the monitor on the rig's TX output device (monitoring into the TX
path would transmit the received band) — pick your actual headphones or
speakers, not the rig codec / DAX TX. What is NOT built is a live
mic-through-app bridge for your own voice: use the rig's own monitor for
that.

---

## No decodes

If you can hear signals by ear but Nexus decodes nothing, check in order:

1. **On macOS: microphone permission.** The rig's RX audio arrives through the
   microphone input, and if the launch-time permission prompt was declined, macOS
   keeps delivering **silence** — no error, a flat waterfall, and every level
   reads zero. Open **System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Microphone**, enable
   **Nexus**, and relaunch the app.
2. **Input device** — Settings ▸ Radio ▸ Audio ▸ Input (RX) must point at the rig's
   receive audio. **Refresh** after plugging in.
3. **Level** — watch the level meter in the top bar. Aim for the green zone. Too
   low and there's nothing to decode; red is clipping and distorts everything.
4. **Passband** — the decoder listens 200–2900 Hz by default. If you narrowed
   F Low / F High, signals outside that window are silently skipped; restore the
   defaults if unsure.
5. **Decode depth** — default is **Deep** (most sensitive). If you dropped it to
   Fast to save CPU, try Normal or Deep.
6. **Clock sync** (below) — a slot that's off by more than about a second produces
   no decodes at all.

<!-- TODO: capture screenshot — the top-bar level meter sitting in the green zone during receive -->

### Clock / time sync

FT8 and FT4 need your UTC clock accurate to within roughly **±1 second**. The
top-bar clock-offset indicator should read close to zero.

- **Windows:** Settings ▸ Time & Language ▸ Date & time ▸ **Sync now**, or run
  `w32tm /resync` from an elevated prompt.
- **macOS:** System Settings ▸ General ▸ Date & Time ▸ **Set time and date
  automatically**, or run `sudo sntp -sS time.apple.com` in Terminal.
- **Off-grid, no internet:** use a GPS or a local NTP source.

Nexus measures the NTP offset and steers its own TX/RX slot grid to compensate,
but it can only correct a *measured* offset — an OS clock that isn't disciplined
by NTP at all will eventually drift past the correction range.

---

## Rotator

### The compass reads "ROTOR —" and the antenna never moves

Almost always one of three things, in this order.

**1. The baud does not match the model.** This is the big one, and it looks
exactly like broken hardware: the port opens, the daemon comes up, and the
controller ignores every byte because it is listening at a different rate. There
is no universal rotator baud — the SPID Rot2Prog runs at **600**, the Rot1Prog at
**1200**, and the Idiom Press Rotor-EZ, Hy-Gain DCU-1 and Green Heron RT-21 at
**4800**, while only the GS-232 family, the M2 RC2800 and the Prosistels use
9600. Go to **Settings ▸ Radio ▸ Rotator** and **re-pick your model**: Nexus
fills in the rate its Hamlib backend declares, and the hint under the baud box
says in words when the saved number cannot work. (Before 1.7.0 every model was
given 9600, which is why an owner of any of those five had a rotator that never
answered.)

**2. The port is wrong, or something else has it.** Same COM port rules as CAT —
and if the port does not exist, the rotator daemon does not linger, it exits
immediately.

**3. The daemon is not running.** See below.

### Reading the daemon's own error

**Settings ▸ Radio ▸ Connections log**, filtered to **Rotator**, is where the
answer is. Nexus captures `rotctld`'s stderr and prints Hamlib's own words:

- `rotctld launched (model 901 on COM7 @ 600, :4533)` — it is up. Any failure
  after this is on the wire, not the daemon.
- `rotctld could not start … serial_open: serial port COM7 does not exist` — the
  port name is wrong, or the adapter is unplugged.
- `… serial port COM7 is already open` — another program (a logger, another copy
  of Nexus, PstRotator) holds it. Close that first; a serial port has one owner.
- `Nexus could not start its own rotctld` — its bundled copy would not launch and
  no system Hamlib was there to fall back on. Installing one fixes it:
  `sudo apt install libhamlib-utils` / `brew install hamlib`.
- `the rotator stopped answering during the … pass` — the daemon is fine and the
  controller went quiet mid-pass. Power, cable, or the controller left in local.

### It turns, but the app says nothing about where it is

Some rotators genuinely cannot report their position: Hamlib's Hy-Gain DCU-1
backend has no read-back at all. The Rotor pane shows `—°T` and keeps the rose,
the typed bearing and STOP — pointing works, the compass just has nothing to
draw. That is the rotator, not a fault.

### "Rotator not answering" but it is right there

Click the chip — it opens **Settings ▸ Radio ▸ Rotator** on the model and port.
Check the model number first (`rotctl -l` lists every one your Hamlib knows), the
port second, the baud third. If you run your own `rotctld`, remember the external
address field **overrides** the model and port entirely, and it needs the port:
`192.168.1.50` on its own is not an address.

Full setup guide: [Antenna rotator setup](rigs/rotators.md).

## TX problems

### TX won't arm / Enable TX has no effect

- **The arm latch** — like WSJT-X, Nexus requires you to arm TX explicitly
  (Enable TX in the Operate cockpit) before any transmission. Digital does not
  auto-arm on section entry; Phone and CW do.
- **License-class lockout** — if the dial is outside your declared license
  segment, the TX button shows a lock and every TX path independently refuses to
  key. Check Settings ▸ Station (default **Open**, no lockout).
- **TX watchdog** — after ~6 minutes of continuous unattended TX the engine
  auto-halts and shows a watchdog chip. Re-arm Enable TX to clear it.

### TX won't stop / stuck PTT

Hit **Esc** in any cockpit — it drops PTT and halts the sequencer immediately.
If the rig stays keyed after Esc: on CAT PTT, run **Test CAT** to confirm
rigctld is still alive; on serial RTS/DTR, check the COM port and control line;
on VOX, the rig's threshold may be holding on residual noise. Note that
switching bands also halts TX by design — a QSY mid-over is never carried to
the new band.

For split-mode internals (Fake-It / Rig Split and how the VFO is always
restored), see the [manual's TX section](manual/Troubleshooting.md#tx-problems).

---

## Map feeds — "quiet" vs "down"

The Now-Bar shows feed-liveness pills for the DX cluster and PSK Reporter. Read
them before assuming something's broken:

- **connected** (no data yet) is normal on a quiet band — it is *not* a failure.
- **connecting / reconnecting** means it's still trying; a stuck **reconnecting**
  means the host is unreachable (a firewall blocking outbound TCP on the cluster
  port is the usual culprit on corporate or hotel Wi-Fi).
- Your **callsign must be set** (3–10 characters, at least one letter and one
  digit) before the PSK Reporter subscription starts at all.

<!-- TODO: capture screenshot — the Now-Bar feed pills distinguishing a "connected" (quiet) feed from a "reconnecting" one -->

---

## UI — themes and scaling

- **Three themes** live in Settings: **Dark** (default), **Light**, and **Amber**
  (night-vision). They apply instantly, no restart.
- **UI scale** has four steps — 90% / 100% / 110% / 125% (default 125% for
  high-DPI screens). If the interface feels too big or too small, adjust it here.
- Theme and scale are stored per-machine (in the webview's own store —
  WebView2 under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.kd9taw.tempo` on Windows, WKWebView on
  macOS, WebKitGTK on Linux), so they don't travel with a copied
  `settings.json` and reset if that store is cleared.

---

## Where the Connections log lives

Connector activity — every LoTW/QRZ/ClubLog/eQSL/HRDLog push and its result — is
recorded in the **Connections log** at **Settings ▸ Logging & Connectors ▸
Connections** (the last 200 events). When an upload "isn't working," this log
shows the actual server response, which is what separates a credential problem
from a service outage or a changed web page. Check it before assuming the worst.

<!-- TODO: capture screenshot — Settings ▸ Logging & Connectors ▸ Connections showing the Connections log with recent upload events and their outcomes -->

---

## Filing a good bug report

A report we can act on has three things:

1. **The version** — the build hash from the Settings header, so we know exactly
   which build you're on.
2. **Your rig and setup** — rig model, connection (USB / network), OS.
3. **What you saw vs. what you expected** — band, dial, mode, and for connector
   issues, the relevant lines from the **Connections log**.

4. **The diagnostic log** — attach `nexus-diag.log` ([where to find it](#the-diagnostic-log--what-to-send-us-when-it-wont-start)).
   It is the single most useful thing you can send, and it is the *only* thing that helps
   when Nexus will not start far enough to show you a version number. Credentials are masked
   before they are written, so it is safe to post publicly.

File it at <https://sourceforge.net/p/nexus-ham-radio/tickets/>. That detail is the difference
between a fix and a round-trip of questions.
