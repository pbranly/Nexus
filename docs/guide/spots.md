# Spots

Spots is the raw feed: every DX-cluster and Reverse Beacon Network spot Nexus has
taken in over the last twenty minutes, in one table, unranked. It is the "what's
on the air" list — the [Needed board](needed-dx.md) is the "what should I work"
list. Nothing here is scored against your log, nothing is hidden because you
worked it in 1998, and nothing carries an evidence line; you get the report as it
arrived, a column to sort it by, and the same single-click work-it path the
Needed board has.

Spots is on by default: the first-run Goals step keeps it on under **DX
chasing & awards**, **Contesting** and **Everything (expert)** and leaves it off
under the other three profiles, and
[Settings ▸ Appearance ▸ Features](settings-reference.md#features) turns it on
or off any time. It describes itself there as "Every cluster/RBN spot on the air
— the raw firehose, filter by band/mode."

## The tour

**The header** holds the row count and, whenever anything is narrowing the list, a
second count reading "of *N*" — so you always know how much of the firehose you
are looking at. Beside it sit the hint "every spot on the air — single-click to
work it", the search box, and the **Filter** button, which reads **Filtered**
while any chip filter is set.

**What feeds it.** Two RBN skimmer firehoses — CW and digital — plus *every*
human DX-cluster node you list in
[Settings ▸ Logging & Connectors](settings-reference.md#integrations--feeds),
unioned into one buffer. RBN carries CW and digital only, so phone rows come
from the human nodes: with no node configured this board is nearly all CW and
FT8. PSK Reporter does **not** feed it — that is the Needed board's evidence
lane and the propagation nowcast's — and neither do your own radio's decodes.
The panel re-reads the buffer every 15 seconds, so a spot is on screen within a
quarter-minute of the feed carrying it, and it ages out of the buffer at 20
minutes (the Needed board's window is 15, so Spots holds a station about five
minutes longer).

**One row per station per frequency.** A second report of the same call within
2 kHz replaces the row and resets its age rather than adding another line, so a
station being spotted every thirty seconds by six skimmers stays one row that
stays fresh instead of filling the screen.

**The columns**, left to right:

- **Age** — compact: seconds under a minute, then minutes, then hours.
- **Call** — a button, not text. Clicking it opens that station's QRZ.com page in
  your browser and does *not* work the spot.
- **Entity** — the DXCC entity resolved from the callsign; `—` when it doesn't
  resolve.
- **St** — the US state resolved for the spot, `—` when it could not be. It is a
  hint from the FCC callsign→state index, refined by a cached grid for a station
  you have heard before; sorting by it puts the unresolved rows last in both
  directions.
- **Band** — the band-plan label, `—` when the frequency is off the plan.
- **Freq** — MHz to three decimals.
- **Mode** — the specific mode when the RBN wire carried one (FT8, FT4, RTTY, PSK,
  CW), otherwise the class Nexus derives from the frequency: CW, Phone or Digital.
  Hovering says which you are looking at ("FT8 spot (Digital)"). A human node's
  free-text mode is never read as a mode.
- **Spotter** — who reported it most recently.
- **Comment** — the spot's comment text, verbatim.

**Sorting.** Seven of the nine headings are buttons — Age, Call, Entity, St, Band,
Freq, Mode. Click to sort, click the same one again to reverse it; an arrow marks
the active column. Band sorts by frequency, because a band column ordered by
frequency reads the way a band map does. Ties break by age in the sort's own
direction — newest first ascending, oldest first once you reverse it. Spotter and
Comment don't sort.

**The filter drawer** opens from the Filter button and holds five controls plus Clear. Two of
them work in opposite directions, which is the thing to learn:

- **Band chips** — 160 m through 6 m always, plus any other band present in the
  current spots. **Selected means *show only these*.** Nothing selected shows every band.
- **Mode chips** — the specific modes actually in the feed right now, in operating
  order (CW, Phone, then the digital submodes). These work the other way round:
  everything is shown by default and clicking a chip *hides* that mode ("Hide FT4
  spots"). Nexus stores what you hid, not what you kept, so a mode that first
  turns up mid-session shows rather than arriving silently hidden.
- **US state chips** — the states resolved for the spots in hand. **Selected means *show only
  these***, and a spot whose state didn't resolve drops out while any state chip is on.
- **My privileges** — "Show only spots you may transmit to under your license
  class ([Settings ▸ Station](settings-reference.md#station)). Open class sees
  everything either way." The flag is computed from the same tables as the
  transmit lockout, so what survives this filter is exactly what you can key on.
- **Heard on my continent** — **this one starts ON.** It keeps only the spots somebody on your
  continent actually heard. A station reported solely from another continent says nothing about
  a path from your station, which is the same test the Needed board applies. The chip carries
  the count of what it is holding back — *Heard on my continent · 326 hidden* — so the answer to
  "where are my spots" is on the chip. Turn it off for the worldwide cluster feed.
- **Clear** wipes the chips, the privileges toggle and the continent filter. **It does not touch
  the search box** — that is the one thing Clear leaves alone.

While any chip filter is set the drawer stays on screen — you can't end up
looking at a short list with no visible sign of what is shortening it, and the Filter button
itself reads **Filtered**.

**Search** narrows on space-separated terms that AND together, each term matching
any field: call, entity, spotter, mode, band or frequency. So `w1 20m cw` is
W1-callsigns spotted on 20 m CW. A term may carry a wildcard and is then matched as a whole
word — `PA*` finds the PA prefix, the same way it does in the Tempo stations list; a term
without one behaves as it always has. `Esc` or the ✕ clears it. The Comment column is
displayed but not searched.

Filters, search text, sort column and the drawer's open state all survive leaving
the section and coming back — they are held for the life of the app run and go
when you quit.

## Core workflows

### Work a spot

1. Click the row anywhere except the callsign. Nexus QSYs band, mode and exact
   frequency in one step and opens the cockpit matching the spot's mode class:
   CW → CW, Phone → Phone, everything else → the digital cockpit.
2. On an FT8 or FT4 row the tier switches first, then the QSY to the spot's exact
   frequency wins over the tier's default dial — click an FT4 spot and the decoder
   is on FT4, not left on FT8.
3. If the freshest comment for that call names a listening offset — `UP 2`,
   `DN 1.5`, or `QSX 14025.5` (an absolute listening frequency in kHz) — rig split
   is pre-set so your transmit lands where the DX is listening.
4. On a CW or Phone row the callsign is prefilled in the log strip; a toast
   confirms "▶ *CALL* — *mode band*, ready to log".
5. If the matching cockpit is switched off (CW, Phone and RTTY are all opt-in),
   the rig still QSYs and you stay where you are rather than being dropped on a
   hidden view.

An RTTY row opens the **digital** cockpit at the RTTY frequency, not the RTTY
cockpit — only FT8 and FT4 route by submode; everything else routes by the
frequency-derived class. The row's tooltip offers "Work *CALL* …" only when the
spot's band is one your band plan knows; on any other band it just names the spot,
frequency and spotter.

<!-- TODO: capture screenshot — the filter drawer open with "My privileges" active and two band chips selected, the header reading "Filtered", and a row hover showing the "Work W1AW — CW @ 14.025 MHz (spotted by K3LR)" tooltip -->

### Cut the firehose down to what you can work

![The Spots header and filter drawer. The header reads "SPOTS 1520 of 1846 · every spot on the air — single-click to work it". The drawer has three chip rows: bands 160m 80m 40m 30m 20m 17m 15m 12m 10m 6m 60m 2m 4m, none selected; modes CW, Phone, FT8, FT4, RTTY, Digital; and the US states AK through WY. At the end sit My privileges, a lit chip reading "Heard on my continent · 326 hidden", and Clear. Below, the table header AGE ▲ CALL ENTITY ST BAND FREQ MODE SPOTTER COMMENT over rows one second old: KD4MSR United States GA 40m 7.031 CW, N9PVW LA 17m 18.100 FT8, K8FN OH 30m 10.123 CW, PG7R Netherlands 80m 3.573 FT8.](../img/manual/spots-filters.webp)

*Spots in Nexus 1.10.3 on a busy evening. Only one filter is on — the default one — and the
header shows exactly what it costs: **1520 of 1846**, with the chip itself saying **326
hidden**. The bands and states are the operator's own; nothing here is a setting to copy.*

**Read the header before anything else.** The big number is what you are looking at; the "of
*N*" beside it is what came in. They differ whenever something is narrowing the list, and the
difference is the whole arithmetic: **1846 in the buffer − 326 held back by the continent
filter = 1520 on screen.** No filter is silent.

A worked pass, from that starting state:

| Step | What you click | What happens to the count |
|---|---|---|
| **Start** | nothing | `1520 of 1846`. Filter reads **Filtered**, because "Heard on my continent" is on by default. |
| **See everything** | the **Heard on my continent** chip, turning it off | The 326 come back. The header drops the "of *N*" — nothing is narrowing any more. |
| **Include a band** | **20m** | Only 20 m rows remain. Add **40m** and you get 20 m *and* 40 m — band chips are a show-only-these set, so each one you add *widens* the result. |
| **Exclude a mode** | **FT8** | FT8 rows go. Mode chips run the other way — everything shows until you click, and each click *narrows*. The hover says which way round you are: "Show FT8 spots" or "Hide FT8 spots". |
| **Include a state** | **TX** | Only Texas rows survive — *and* every row whose state never resolved drops too, so this cuts harder than it looks. |
| **Search** | type `cq` in the box | Terms AND together across call, entity, spotter, mode, band and frequency, on top of whatever the chips left. |
| **Reset** | **Clear** | Every chip, **My privileges** and the continent filter go back to nothing selected. **The search box still says `cq`** — Clear does not touch it. Clear that with `Esc` or its own ✕. |

The rule in one line: **band and state chips include, mode chips exclude, search is a separate
narrowing on top, and Clear resets everything except the search.**

For the common job — trimming to what you can actually work:

1. Open **Filter** and turn on **My privileges** — everything you may not transmit
   to disappears. (An Open-class, non-US operator has every spot licensed, so the
   toggle changes nothing.)
2. Select the band chips you have an antenna for.
3. Hide the modes you don't operate — one click per mode chip.
4. Leave **Heard on my continent** on unless you are deliberately looking at the worldwide
   feed.

What's left is a working list, and it stays that way while you move around the app.

### Chase a state for WAS

Open **Filter**, pick the state chips you still need, and sort by Age. Only spots
whose state Nexus could resolve remain — a cluster spot of a station it can't place
is not shown as "maybe", it's gone while the filter is on.

### Find one station in a contest weekend

Type into the search box. A call fragment, an entity, a spotter's call or a
frequency all match, and terms stack: `ja 15m` is Japan on 15 metres. When the
board is empty it says which case you're in — "No spots match the current filters
— clear to see all", or "No spots yet — cluster/RBN spots appear here as they
arrive."

## Honest limits

- **No ranking and no log awareness.** No need chips, no ATNO colouring, no
  worked-before marking, no evidence line, and no dedupe against your log — a row
  is a report, not an opportunity. Everything that judges a station's value to
  *your* log lives on the [Needed board](needed-dx.md).
- **Cluster and RBN only.** PSK Reporter reception reports and your own radio's
  decodes never appear here, however good the path they prove. And since RBN
  skimmers only spot CW and digital, phone coverage is exactly as wide as the
  human cluster nodes you have configured.
- **The Mode column is a judgement about frequency**, except where an RBN skimmer
  named the mode. A DX SSB station parked below the US phone edge on 40 or 80 m
  (7.085, say) falls in the data window and reads Digital. That is deliberate: the
  free-text mode token in a spot comment is unreliable everywhere else, so the
  number on the dial is trusted instead.
- **Beacons and bulletins are not badged on this board.** Nexus does identify
  NCDXF/IARU beacon slots and W1AW bulletin frequencies, and badges them in the
  Phone and CW cockpits' Band Activity strip — this table shows them as ordinary
  rows, so a click can QSY you to a one-way transmission that will never come back
  to you.
- **One spotter per row.** The other stations that reported the same DX are folded
  into the row behind the scenes and not displayed, and CQ zone isn't shown at all.
- **One filter is on before you touch anything.** **Heard on my continent** starts on, so a
  fresh board is already hiding spots nobody on your continent heard. It is not hidden from you
  — the header count and the chip's own "*N* hidden" both say so — but it is the reason a
  count here can be smaller than a cluster window's.
- **Filters are for this run of the app.** They survive leaving the section and
  coming back, and they are gone at exit — unlike the Needed board's, which persist
  across restarts.
- **Spots doesn't tear off.** There is no ⧉ pop-out for this board; the Needed
  board, Connect and the cockpit band maps detach, this one doesn't.
- **Twenty minutes, and nothing before that.** No history, no export, no "what did
  I miss while I was away".
- **Declaring an unassisted entry empties the board.** The switch stops cluster/RBN
  ingestion *and* the read returns nothing, so a spot that arrived a second before
  you flipped it is invisible immediately rather than lingering until the buffer
  drains.
