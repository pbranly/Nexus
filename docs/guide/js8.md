# JS8

JS8 is keyboard-to-keyboard chat on FT8's waveform, on the air compatible with
[JS8Call](https://js8call.com): the same four speeds, the same heartbeats, directed
messages, relays and store-and-forward inbox, so a JS8Call station and a Nexus station
work each other without either knowing the difference. It is a ragchew mode, not a
contest mode — a short exchange takes a few periods, a paragraph takes a minute — and it
is the mode of choice on 40 and 20 m when the band is too poor for voice and FT8's
canned exchange is not a conversation.

**Before you start.** JS8 is on out of the box — look in the Digital group of the rail,
after APRS. If you don't operate it, switch it off in
[Settings ▸ Appearance ▸ Features](settings-reference.md#features). Entering the screen
tunes the rig to the JS8 watering hole for the current band (7.078, 14.078, 3.578 … —
JS8Call's own list, USB) and starts decoding every speed at once. Nothing transmits
until you enable TX in the header, every session. The mode's own switches — transmit
speed, which speeds to decode, heartbeat interval, the three automatic-reply switches,
the idle watchdog and your INFO/STATUS/group texts — are in
[Settings ▸ Digital ▸ JS8](settings-reference.md#js8).

## The tour

**The header.** A **JS8** badge, then the four speed chips — **Slow · Normal · Fast ·
Turbo** (30 / 15 / 10 / 6 second periods); the lit one is the speed *you* transmit at and
the period the TX clock follows. Beside them an **RX ▼ n/4** plate says how many of the
four speeds the receiver is decoding right now (all four by default). Then the band
picker with the JS8 watering holes, license-filtered per band; a **Drive** slider (TX
audio level — set it so the rig's ALC barely moves); **Tune**; an **ATU** button when your
rig reports a tuner; the **TX On / TX Off** latch; **Stop TX**; and **⊞ Panels**.

**The waterfall.** Click sets your RX offset, right-click your TX offset, Shift-click
both. JS8 stations sit anywhere from 500 to 2500 Hz; heartbeats cluster in the
500–1000 Hz sub-band by convention.

**The panes** (each removable from ⊞ Panels):

- **Activity** — every frame decoded at every enabled speed, one row each: UTC, the
  speed letter (E Slow · A Normal · B Fast · C Turbo, JS8Call's ALL.TXT letters), the
  audio offset, the SNR, and the message exactly as JS8Call would print it. Rows
  addressed to you carry a bar; your own transmissions are tinted; faint rows are
  low-confidence copy; italic rows closed without their last frame. Double-click a row
  to write to that station.
- **Stations** — everyone heard, with grid, SNR, offset, speed, age, and chips for a
  recent heartbeat, a recent CQ, and any messages you hold for them. Click a callsign to
  address it; the five quick buttons send **SNR? · GRID? · INFO? · HEARING? · QUERY MSGS**
  to that station, which answers by itself if its auto-reply is on.
- **Inbox** — messages addressed to you, and **MSG TO:** messages you are holding for
  someone else until they collect them (store and forward). Mark read, delete.
- **Log** — the log strip, prefilled from the station you last addressed. A JS8 QSO logs
  as `MFSK` / `JS8` in ADIF.

**The TX dock**, pinned under the panes. The **To** box (blank = everyone, a callsign,
`@ALLCALL`, or a `@GROUP` you belong to), the composer, a frame estimate ("3 frames ·
45 s") and **Send**; a command palette with JS8Call's 32 directed commands; the **CQ**
variant picker and **CQ**; **HB**; the **AUTOREPLY · RELAY · HB ACK** chips; the pending
auto-reply row with its countdown and **Cancel**; the queue with **Drop queue**; and the
idle-watchdog readout.

## Receiving

All four speeds decode at once, exactly as JS8Call's multi-decode does: a Slow station at
−26 dB and a Turbo station rattling off a paragraph on the same band both print. Untick
speeds in Settings if a small machine struggles. A long message arrives one frame per
period and is stitched together by audio offset — you see the frames arrive in Activity,
and the finished message in Inbox if it was for you.

## Transmitting

JS8 keys **one frame per period, every period**, with no even/odd parity — a 60-character
message at Normal is five frames, 75 seconds. **Send** queues the frames; the next period
boundary sends the first. Plain text (no addressee) goes out prefixed with your callsign,
so every frame identifies you.

Everything automatic is gated twice. The first act is the **TX On** latch in the header —
never remembered across launches. The second is the switch for that kind of transmission:
**AUTOREPLY** (answers SNR?, GRID?, INFO?, STATUS?, HEARING?, QUERY MSGS addressed to you),
**RELAY** (passes on messages routed through your callsign and holds MSG TO: traffic),
**HB ACK** (answers heartbeats with your report) — those three persist in Settings, at
JS8Call's defaults (on, on, off) — and **HB**, the heartbeat schedule, which is
session-only. A chip that is on while TX is off shows it plainly, and nothing keys.
Every automatic reply first sits in the dock for one period with a countdown and a
**Cancel**. After an hour with nothing typed (the idle watchdog; adjustable), heartbeats,
auto-reply and relay switch themselves off and the dock says so.

**Stop TX** (header, or **Esc** anywhere in the screen) cuts the frame on the air, empties
the queue, cancels a pending reply and stops the heartbeat schedule. **Drop queue** only
empties the queue — a frame already on the air finishes. Turning **TX Off** lets the
frame in flight complete, as in the FT8 screen.

## Compatibility

On the air: JS8Call 2.2 and later, and JS8Call-improved, at Slow, Normal, Fast and Turbo.
Not implemented: the "JS8 60" / Ultra speed (compiled out of JS8Call itself), and the
APRS-IS and @JS8NET internet gateways. The full protocol reference is
[JS8Call's source](https://github.com/js8call/js8call), read as the specification; see
NOTICE.
