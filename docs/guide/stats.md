# Stats

Stats is your logbook sliced — "QSOs by band, mode, year, hour, entity, and
confirmations." It is descriptive and nothing else: it counts the records you
already have, in bars you can check against the log itself. It makes no award
judgement (that's [Awards](awards-journey.md)), sets no goal (that's Journey),
and has no controls at all — no filter, no date range, no export. Every figure
on the page counts your **whole** logbook unless this page says otherwise.

Stats is on out of the box: a fresh install has it whether you finish the
first-run wizard or skip it — the wizard turns everything on.
[Settings ▸ Appearance ▸ Features](settings-reference.md#features) turns it on
or off any time. If Stats is off when you log your first QSO, Nexus offers it
once as a nudge — it never switches itself on.

## The tour

**Where the numbers come from.** Two sources, and knowing which is which is how
you reconcile a figure that surprises you. Everything except the last three
cards is counted in the app from the same logbook read the
[Logbook](logbook-qsl.md) section shows you — every record, no de-duplication,
no date window. The three geographic cards come from the Rust side, which
re-resolves each **callsign** through cty.dat, because the stored QSO record
carries no continent and no CQ zone.

**The headline row** — four figures across the top:

- **QSOs** — records in the logbook, full stop. Log the same station twice and
  it counts twice.
- **unique calls** — distinct callsigns, case-folded and trimmed. Suffixes are
  not stripped, so `W1AW` and `W1AW/4` are two.
- **DXCC entities** — distinct entities, keyed on the cty.dat resolution of the
  callsign, case-folded so an imported `UNITED STATES` and a resolved
  `United States` are one entity rather than two. A callsign that won't resolve
  falls back to whatever country text the record carries.
- **confirmed** — the share of your QSOs confirmed by **any** channel: LoTW,
  eQSL, a paper card, or a QRZ-logbook match. Rounded to whole percent, so a
  handful of unconfirmed contacts in a large log reads as 100%.
  **This is not the Confirmed card on [Awards](awards-journey.md).** That one
  counts LoTW and paper only, because those are what ARRL takes. Same
  denominator — your whole log — different numerator, so the Awards figure is
  always the lower of the two, and the gap is your eQSL and QRZ confirmations.
  In the screenshot above it is 73% here against 52% there.

**How to read a bar.** In most cards the longest bar is the most-worked item in
*that* card, not 100% of your log — the bars are a ranking. Two cards are
different, and deliberately: **Confirmations** scales against your total QSO
count and **DX vs domestic** against the QSOs that could be placed, so in those
two the bar length is a real share.

**By band, By mode, By year.** Band and mode are the label text **as logged** —
nothing is normalised, **not even the letter case**. An imported log that
writes `USB` and `LSB` gets a bar each rather than folding into `SSB`, and
`20M` and `20m` are two separate bars for the same band. Both cards are
ordered by count, most-worked first, so By band reads as a ranking and not as
a bandplan. By year is the UTC year, oldest first; a record with a timestamp
outside the calendar's range is dropped instead of drawing a `NaN` bar.

![The By band card: 20m 1323, 20M 962, 15m 944, 10m 919, 40m 794, 17m 680, 30m 666, 40M 641, 12m 614, 80m 526, 15M 462, 160M 446, 10M 442, 160m 404, 17M 260, 80M 256, 30M 252, 12M 221, 6M 219, 6m 188, 2m 115, 2M 20, 70cm 9, 60M 6, 60m 4 — every band split into a lowercase and an uppercase bar.](../img/manual/stats-by-band.webp)

*By band in Nexus 1.10.3. This log carries both cases for every band, so each
band appears twice — 20m 1323 and 20M 962 are one band worked 2285 times.*

**Two cases means two bars, and it is worth knowing why.** The entity cards
fold case (an imported `UNITED STATES` and a resolved `United States` are one
row); band and mode do not. A log assembled from more than one source almost
always carries both cases, so this is the normal state of an imported log
rather than a rare one. **Add the pair before you read a band's total**, and
be careful with the ranking: two half-height bars can sit below a band that is
genuinely smaller. If you want one bar per band, the fix is in the records —
make the case consistent in the ADIF and re-import.

**Top DXCC entities** is the top 12 by QSO count, on the same resolved-entity
key as the headline. It is descriptive, not award credit — an entity counts
here the moment you work it, confirmed or not.

**Most-worked states (WAS)** is the top 12 states, and it counts a QSO only if
the record's country is United States, Alaska or Hawaii *and* its ADIF `STATE`
is one of the 50 WAS codes. That gate is the point: without it an Australian
`WA` (Western Australia) and a Brazilian `SC` (Santa Catarina) would pile into
Washington and South Carolina. Casing is folded, so an external logger's `ct`
lands in the `CT` bucket.

**Activity by hour (UTC)** is a 24-bar histogram, labelled every six hours,
each bar as tall as that hour is busy relative to your busiest. Hover a bar for
the exact figure ("`14:00 UTC — 37 QSOs`"). QSOs stamped at exactly 00:00:00
UTC are **not** in it — that is what a QRZ or LoTW import writes when it carries
the date but not the time, and counting it as midnight buries your real pattern
under an import spike. They are counted in a line under the chart instead:
"*n* QSOs not shown — imported with a date but no time of day."

**Confirmations** breaks the headline percentage into four bars — **Award-grade**
(LoTW or paper only, the ones ARRL will take), **LoTW**, **eQSL**, **Paper
card** — each a count of QSOs carrying that channel, drawn against your total.
It is the card that tells you whether a good-looking confirmation rate rests on
anything an award will accept.

**By continent, By CQ zone, DX vs domestic** are the cty.dat cards. Continent is
derived from the station's CQ zone into the six WAC continents, and each row
carries both the QSO count and the distinct entities behind it ("· 14 ent") —
40 QSOs spanning 3 entities is a different log from 40 spanning 20. Zones are
the top 15 you have worked, by QSO count. DX vs domestic is anchored on **your
own** callsign's entity: your entity is domestic, everything else is DX. When
some callsigns can't be placed the card says so plainly — "*n* of *m* QSOs
couldn't be placed by callsign" — and those QSOs appear in no geographic
breakdown at all.

**What the page can be instead of the dashboard.** Before the log arrives it
says "Loading your logbook…". With an empty log it says "No QSOs logged yet —
your stats will fill in here as you work stations." If the read fails it says
"Couldn't read the logbook — try reopening this view." — and that is literally
the recovery: there is no retry button.

**Refresh.** The page reads the log once, when you open the section. It does not
live-update while you sit on it; leave and come back and it re-reads, so a QSO
you logged in a cockpit shows up on your next visit. The cards reflow into as
many columns as your window fits and the page scrolls as one long column of
cards.

## Core workflows

### Reconcile the page against your logbook

1. Read the **QSOs** headline. It is the number of records in the logbook — the
   same set the [Logbook](logbook-qsl.md) section lists.
2. If a card's counts fall short of that, the card is telling you which records
   are missing a field: **By band** and **By mode** drop records with a blank
   band/mode, **Most-worked states (WAS)** drops anything that isn't a US-family
   entity with a valid state code, and the geographic cards drop callsigns
   cty.dat can't place.
3. **Add case variants together before comparing.** By band and By mode split
   `20m` from `20M`, so a band's real total is the sum of its rows. Nothing
   else on the page does this — the entity, state and continent cards all fold
   case.
4. Check which denominator a percentage uses. **confirmed** in the headline is
   any channel; **Award-grade** in the Confirmations card, and the Confirmed
   card on [Awards](awards-journey.md), are LoTW and paper only. Both are over
   your whole log, so the difference between them is entirely eQSL and QRZ.
5. Read the exclusion notes, because they are per card and they are not small:
   "*n* QSOs not shown — imported with a date but no time of day" under
   Activity by hour, and "*n* of *m* QSOs couldn't be placed by callsign" under
   DX vs domestic. In the screenshot above the first of those is 10,667 of
   11,373 contacts — the histogram is describing well under a tenth of the log.
6. Fix the underlying records in the Logbook — the numbers here follow, because
   there is nothing stored on this page to go stale.

### Find the hours you actually operate

1. Open **Activity by hour (UTC)** and hover the tall bars for exact counts.
2. Read the note under the chart first. If it says most of your log has no time
   of day, the histogram is describing your *timed* QSOs only — typically the
   ones Nexus logged, not the ones you imported.
3. Use the shape to choose a session time, then check it against the band with
   [Connect](connect.md) — Stats tells you when *you* have been on, not when the
   band was open.

<!-- TODO: capture screenshot — the Activity by hour (UTC) card with a bar tooltip open, and the "not shown — imported with a date but no time of day" note visible beneath it -->

### See what your confirmation rate rests on

1. Note the **confirmed** headline — that counts every channel, including eQSL
   and a QRZ-logbook match.
2. Compare it with the **Award-grade** bar in **Confirmations**, which counts
   only LoTW and paper. The gap between the two is the work an ARRL award will
   not accept.
3. If the gap is wide, pull confirmations and push your log with the
   [LoTW / eQSL sync](logbook-qsl.md#upload-to-lotw), then reopen Stats.

### Read your DX balance

1. **DX vs domestic** splits on your own entity. If it reads as all DX, check
   that your station callsign is set in
   [Settings ▸ Station](settings-reference.md#station) — with no resolvable home
   entity there is nothing to be domestic against.
2. **By continent** shows where the QSOs went and how many entities they span;
   a continent with many QSOs and few entities is a well-worn path, not
   coverage.
3. Take the thin continents to the [Needed board](needed-dx.md) or
   [DXpeditions](dxpeditions.md) — Stats describes the log, it does not point
   the radio.

## Honest limits

- **Nothing on the page is a control.** No date range, no band/mode filter, no
  sort, no click-through to the QSOs behind a bar, no CSV or image export, and
  no ⧉ pop-out window. Every card counts the whole logbook; slicing by date or
  digging into individual contacts is the [Logbook](logbook-qsl.md)'s job.
- **The figures are a snapshot from when you opened the section.** They do not
  refresh on their own, and the failure message ("try reopening this view") is
  the retry — there is no reload button.
- **Field Day contacts are not counted.** While Field Day is active a contact
  goes to the contest log only, which is journaled as its own ADIF file; those
  QSOs reach Stats only if you import that file back into the logbook. See
  [Field Day & POTA/SOTA](contesting-pota.md).
- **No grid squares.** There is no VUCC or grid-square card here at all — grids
  are counted in [Awards](awards-journey.md), and the per-band grid counts there
  cover 160 m through 2 m, so a 70 cm contact has no per-band slot to land in.
- **No POTA/SOTA, satellite, power or distance breakdown.** Those fields are in
  your records and used elsewhere in the app; this dashboard does not slice by
  them.
- **A QRZ-logbook confirmation counts in the headline but has no bar.** The
  Confirmations card shows Award-grade, LoTW, eQSL and Paper card only, so on a
  QRZ-heavy log the four bars will not add up to the **confirmed** percentage.
  There is no way to read the QRZ figure off this page; the gap between the
  headline and the Award-grade bar is the closest you get, and it also
  contains eQSL.
- **Band and mode are not normalised, and case is the usual reason a total
  looks wrong.** `20m` and `20M` are two rows for one band. This is a
  limitation of the page, not of your log — the records are fine, the card
  groups on the exact string.
- **Old records can undercount the four Confirmations bars.** The per-source QSL
  flags can be all-false on records whose sync predates the per-channel split;
  those QSOs still count as confirmed in the headline while contributing to no
  channel bar.
- **A QSO genuinely worked at exactly 00:00:00 UTC drops out of the hour
  histogram.** The chart cannot tell it from a date-only import, and it is
  counted in the "not shown" line instead.
- **The states card keys on the country text, not the resolved entity.** A
  record whose country is spelled anything other than United States, Alaska or
  Hawaii — "USA", say, from an imported log — is left out of the WAS breakdown
  even when its state code is perfectly good.
- **Unplaceable callsigns sit out the geography.** They are in the QSOs
  headline and the caption's "couldn't be placed" figure, and in no continent,
  zone or DX/domestic count. If the geographic call itself fails, those three
  cards are simply absent — the rest of the page still renders, and nothing
  announces the gap.
- **These counts are not award credit.** They include WAE/CQ-only entities and
  make no confirmation requirement, so the DXCC entity figure here will read
  higher than the DXCC tracker in [Awards](awards-journey.md). That is the two
  pages doing different jobs, not a disagreement.
