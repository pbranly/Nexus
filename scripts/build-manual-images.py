"""build-manual-images.py — turn raw Nexus screen captures into manual images.

Deterministic and re-runnable: point it at a directory of captures and it writes
docs/img/manual/*.webp. Re-run it after a recapture and only the changed files move.

WHY WEBP. Measured on a real 1915x1151 capture of the Satellites console:

    format          1920 px wide
    PNG (optimized)     774 KB
    JPEG q88            446 KB      + artifacts on UI text, which is most of the frame
    WEBP q92            218 KB      <- half the source PNG, at full resolution

The site's own hand-optimized screenshots sit at 82-147 KB, but those are marketing
crops; a reference manual needs the readable detail. ~218 KB x ~24 images lands near
5 MB, which roughly doubles the site's public/ and stays far inside every limit.

WHY 1920 WIDE. The capture guidance is a 1920x1080 LOGICAL window, because the app's
auto-zoom is min(w/1200, h/900) capped at 100% -- at 1920x1080 that resolves to exactly
100%, so type renders un-shrunk. Captures from a HiDPI display arrive larger than 1920
and are downscaled here; the extra source detail is what makes the downscale clean.
Captures are never UPSCALED -- a small source stays small rather than being blurred up.

THIS SCRIPT ONLY CONVERTS. It does not crop, and a whole-window capture converted at
1920 is unreadable once the manual squeezes it to column width -- about 176 mm in the
PDF, where 12 px of UI text lands near 3 pt. Cropping to the panel that matters is the
fix, and it is a judgement this tool cannot make for you.

*** READ docs/manual-style-guide.md BEFORE ADDING AN IMAGE. *** It carries the house
rules this script's settings are half of: what to crop to, how to name it, the short
alt text, the visible caption with version context, numbered legends, the privacy
check on a real operator's station, and the rule that the instructions must still work
with every image stripped out. It also carries the chapter template and the evidence
marks, so it is the one page to read before editing docs/guide/ at all.
