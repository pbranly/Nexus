// The documentation pass that closes a release. Run it AFTER the release is live.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Every release moves code and leaves the doc set behind, and nothing has ever
// gone red about it. 1.3.0 proved it three separate ways in one release:
//
//   1. Settings went from eight tabs to nine ("Modes" split into Phone/CW/Digital, "Rig Control"
//      renamed "Rig & CAT", Frequencies folded into Digital). Roughly thirty-four doc files still
//      described the old panel, and every one was found BY HAND, after the release had shipped.
//   2. Three manual screenshots still showed the eight-tab panel. They had not been recaptured
//      since 2026-08-04; the panel changed on 2026-08-12.
//   3. The CHANGELOG credited "(#2, #8)" as fixed in 1.3.0. Both issues were, and are, OPEN.
//      That one reached the public.
//
// And a fourth, found while writing this: `scripts/gen-wiki.mjs` has THROWN on every invocation
// since a6097c92 (2026-08-09), because docs/install.md stopped containing the text one of its
// required replacements is keyed on. Three releases shipped over the top of a generator that
// could not run, because nothing ran it. That is the shape of the whole problem — the mechanism
// existed and was never wired to anything that fires.
//
// So this is a RUNNER, not a new pile of logic. Where a checker already exists it is invoked;
// where the answer is in git it is computed; where only a human can judge it is printed with the
// specific file, line and commit rather than as a checklist item saying "review the docs".
//
// *** THIS TOOL IS READ-ONLY. It writes no file, stages nothing, and every git call it makes  ***
// *** is a query (log / status / tag). Other agents work in this checkout — see CLAUDE.md's   ***
// *** working protocol. It reports; you fix.                                                  ***
//
// TWO SEVERITIES, and the difference is deliberate:
//   FAIL   — mechanically wrong. Exits 1. Fix it before you call the release closed.
//   REVIEW — a human has to look. Exits 0, printed last, above the manual steps. These do NOT
//            fail the run, because a check that is red every single release is a check that gets
//            switched off, and then the FAILs go with it.
//
// Run:   node scripts/release-docs.mjs
//        node scripts/release-docs.mjs --version 1.3.0   (default: src-tauri/tauri.conf.json)

// 3. Screenshots — against git history, never against mtime
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// ⚠️ FILE MTIME IS MEANINGLESS HERE. `git checkout` and `git worktree add` rewrite it, so every
// image in a fresh clone looks like it was captured this morning. The only honest question is
// which COMMIT last touched the image versus which commit last touched the code it depicts.
//
// The mapping has to be declared, because nothing in an image says what it shows. An image with
// no entry FAILS rather than being skipped: an unmapped capture is a check quietly shrinking,
// which is how the gap this whole script exists for opened in the first place.
//
// WHY THIS IS A PREFIX TABLE AND NOT ONE LINE PER IMAGE. It was one line per image while there
// were eleven. The illustrated manual is going to ~90, and 33 of those are Settings tabs that
// all show the same two files — so a per-image table would be 33 identical right-hand sides
// maintained by hand, on eight branches at once, all editing the same object literal. That is
// not a gate anyone keeps; it is a merge conflict with a check attached.
//
// So a key is a FAMILY PREFIX, and the LONGEST key that a filename starts with wins. Order in
// this object is irrelevant — you cannot break another family's mapping by where you paste
// yours, which is the footgun a first-match-wins list would have.
//
//   'settings-'        matches settings-radio.webp, settings-audio.webp, all 33 of them
//   'operate-'         matches operate-waterfall.webp
//   'operate-classic'  is longer, so it beats 'operate-' for operate-classic.webp
//
// HOW TO ADD AN IMAGE. Name it for what it shows (see scripts/build-manual-images.py). If its
// family prefix is already here, you add NOTHING — the new capture is checked the moment it
// lands. If it is a new family, add ONE key naming the source files whose change would make
// the picture wrong. Do not add a key that names a whole directory or a barrel file: an owner
// that changes every week reports staleness every week, and that is the same as reporting none.
//
// A key that matches no image today is NOT a failure — it is a family nobody has captured yet,
// costs nothing, and pre-declaring it is what keeps eight branches out of each other's diffs.
// (An exact per-image key that matched nothing WAS a failure, because it meant a real image had
// been renamed out from under its mapping. A prefix cannot hide that: an image matching no key
// still FAILS.) Unused keys are counted in the ok line so a dead family stays visible.

// "(#2, #8)" was published in the 1.3.0 CHANGELOG as fixed. Both were open then and are open
// now. This is the only check here that needs the network, so it degrades to a loud SKIP rather
// than a silent pass when `gh` cannot answer.
//
// TWO THINGS IT USED TO GET WRONG, both found on 1.10.3 and both the sort that gets a check
// switched off rather than obeyed:
//
//   * `gh issue list` cannot see DISCUSSIONS. 1.10.3 credits "(#231, #232)" — #231 is the issue
//     and #232 is the discussion the same fault was reported in, which is a correct credit and
//     was reported as "#232 is not an issue in kd9taw/Nexus". A number is now looked up as a
//     discussion before it is called missing.
//   * "cited ⇒ must be CLOSED" is not true of a fix the maintainer cannot yet prove. 1.10.3
//     shipped two fixes marked **NEEDS-BENCH** — the project-wide flag for "the change is in,
//     the hardware to confirm it on is not here" (#126 wants an FTDX-101D, #233 a Mac). Those
//     issues stay open on purpose, possibly for months, and there is no repo edit that clears
//     them: a permanent FAIL nobody can act on is exactly how the FAILs stop being read. So an
//     open issue whose own CHANGELOG bullet carries NEEDS-BENCH is REVIEW, listed by name, and
//     an open issue with no such marker is still a FAIL. NEEDS-BENCH is not a mute button: it
//     is published to the operator in the release notes, so writing a false one is a public
//     claim, not a private silencing.
