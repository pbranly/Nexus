//! Cloudlog / Wavelog QSO upload (HTTP JSON). Cloudlog (and its Wavelog fork) are self-hosted
//! web logbooks with an identical QSO API: `POST {base}/index.php/api/qso` with the instance
//! API key + station-profile id + one ADIF record. The URL + JSON builders are pure (unit-
//! tested); [`upload`] does the blocking POST.
//!
//! # ⛔ Where the API key is kept out of, and by what
//!
//! The key rides in the REQUEST body, and an instance can echo a request back — a debug-mode
//! PHP notice, a WAF page, a proxy error. So every string this module hands upwards is
//! assumed to be able to contain the key, and the boundary that matters is **what gets
//! written down**:
//!
//! - **Persisted** (`conn-health.json`, mode 0644, survives the session): guarded by an
//!   ALLOW-LIST at the sink — `note_conn_health` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` takes a
//!   `ConnDetail`, which can only be built from a string literal, so nothing derived from a
//!   response can reach it at all. That is the guarantee, and it is the only one. What this
//!   module gives that sink is [`CloudlogFailure`] — a closed set of CLASSES, so the row can
//!   still name which failure it was without persisting a character the instance wrote.
//! - **Ephemeral** (the operator's toast for this upload, and the in-memory connection log):
//!   carries the instance's own words, because #226 is precisely that Nexus threw them away.
//!   [`echoes_key`] reduces the chance the key is among them, and **it is best-effort, not a
//!   guarantee** — see its own note. Do not build anything on it, and do not add a round to
//!   it: three were spent, and the server picks the encoding.
//! - **stderr is NOT ephemeral, and that is why [`CloudlogError`] has no `Display`.** On
//!   Linux the desktop session redirects a GUI process's stderr into `~/.xsession-errors`,
//!   mode 0644, which outlives the session exactly as `conn-health.json` does. A type that
//!   formats itself is one `eprintln!` away from that file, so this one does not; read
//!   `.message` where the instance's words are actually wanted.
