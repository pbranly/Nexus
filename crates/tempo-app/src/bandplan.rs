//! Tempo's proposed calling-frequency band plan.
//!
//! Tempo is a NEW narrow weak-signal text mode (FT1 ~150 Hz, DX1 ~50 Hz), so it
//! must **not** sit on the established FT8 / FT4 / JS8 / WSPR / PSK watering holes
//! (mutual QRM), and it must stay clear of CW activity and the VHF/UHF FM calling
//! / satellite / repeater segments.
//!
//! Every entry here was chosen so that — for a USB signal with the usual ~1500 Hz
//! audio offset, i.e. an emission ~1.5 kHz above the dial — the **emission falls
//! inside the US General-class data privileges** (General has the HF data
//! sub-bands and full privileges on 160 m / 6 m and band-wide data above 50 MHz),
//! and sits clear of the CW calling frequencies. These are **proposed, editable
//! defaults** to coordinate with the community — the operator can override any
//! frequency manually.
//!
//! HF placement = "upper shoulder of the digital cluster" (a few kHz above
//! FT8/JS8/FT4, below WSPR). VHF/UHF = a USB weak-signal calling freq and, where
//! it fits a band-plan digital/experimental segment, an FM-simplex DATA channel
//! for FM-HT users — always offset clear of the FM national calling freqs
//! (146.520 / 446.000 / 223.500), APRS, satellite, and repeater sub-bands.

        // the one 5.357 dialled, and where 60 m FT8 lived worldwide — was ELIMINATED as a
        // channel and folded into the low-power segment.
        //
        // So when the report was filed, 5.3715 was the wrong dial and 5.357 was the right one.

        // POWER, which is why this stays one row rather than becoming a guess:
        //   5.3715 — US channel, 100 W ERP, and where US FT8 moved to keep that power after the
        //            change (w3pie.org, 2026-02-13, read 2026-09-07). US-ONLY: most of the world

///   * MSK144 has NO HF PRESENCE AT ALL — it is 6 m/4 m/2 m/70 cm meteor
///     scatter. Handing it 14.074 points the rig at a band the mode is not used
///     on.
///   * Q65 is likewise VHF+ (6 m through 1.2 cm); its HF entries do not exist.
///   * FST4/FST4W are LF/MF — 2200 m, 630 m, 160 m — the opposite end of the
///     spectrum from FT8.
///   * WSPR's HF frequencies differ from FT8's everywhere (20 m is 14.0956, not
///     14.074), so an operator on "20 m WSPR" would have been listening to FT8.
///   * JT65 is 14.076 on 20 m, not 14.074.
