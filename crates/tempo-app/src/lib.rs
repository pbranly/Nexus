//! Tempo application logic — the UI-facing layer that wraps [`tempo_core`].
//!
//! [`AppState`] owns the operator's identity, an [`inbox::Inbox`] (roster +
//! attributed inbound chat), a [`store::StoreForward`] queue for outbound
//! directed messages, per-peer [`dto::Conversation`] threads, and the current
//! [`dto::RadioStatus`] / [`dto::LinkState`]. Its public methods are the command
//! surface a Tauri shell (or a test harness) drives; they return serializable
//! [`dto`] types so the frontend renders directly from them.
//!
//! This crate is deliberately **pure logic**: no Tauri, no audio devices, no
//! threads. A real engine pumps decoded [`tempo_fast::Decode`]s in via [`AppState::observe`]
//! and reads [`AppState::snapshot`] out; here those edges are exercised by unit
//! tests over synthetic decodes.
