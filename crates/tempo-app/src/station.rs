//! Station-wide state — the half of the engine that belongs to the OPERATOR, not to a radio.
//!
//! [`Engine`](crate::engine::Engine) mixes two kinds of state: things that are true of the
//! STATION (one logbook, one ADIF file, one connector-upload funnel, one DXCC table, one
//! POTA activation, one PC clock) and things that are true of ONE RECEIVE/TRANSMIT CHAIN
//! (this waterfall, this slot clock, this dial, this TX queue). Only the second kind can
//! meaningfully exist more than once.
//!
//! `StationCore` is the first kind, lifted out verbatim. Today [`Engine`](crate::engine::Engine)
//! owns exactly one by value and the chain count is hard-capped at one, so this is a pure
//! relocation with no behavior change — the point is that the seam now EXISTS and the
//! compiler enforces which side each field is on. When a second chain arrives, N engines
//! share one core instead of each growing a divergent copy of the operator's log.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT here: `settings`, `app` (identity/roster/conversations),
//! `pending_log`, `highlights`, `clear_tick`, `work_tick`, `broker_ptt` and `radio_live`.
//! Each is genuinely both-sided and needs a design ruling, not a default; they stay on
//! [`Engine`](crate::engine::Engine) untouched.
