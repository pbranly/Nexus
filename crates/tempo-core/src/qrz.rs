//! Pure QRZ.com XML callsign-lookup helpers — the offline, unit-testable core of
//! the QRZ enrichment connector (mirrors [`crate::lotw`]/[`crate::eqsl`]). No I/O.
//!
//! QRZ's XML API is a **two-step session-key** flow (unlike LoTW/eQSL's
//! per-request credentials): log in once with the account username+password to
//! get an opaque session `<Key>`, then look up callsigns with `?s=<key>`. This
//! module builds both URLs, parses the `<Session>` block (key / quota / errors)
//! and the `<Callsign>` data block, and detects session expiry. The thin HTTPS
//! transport lives behind the `live` feature elsewhere.
//!
//! ⚠️ Both the login URL (password) and the lookup URL (session key) are
//! secret-bearing; the transport must redact errors. The session `<Key>` is a
//! bearer secret, so [`QrzSession`]'s `Debug` redacts it (and [`QrzLogin`]'s
//! redacts the password).
//!
//! ⚠️ Subscription reality: a FREE QRZ account's XML returns only name/address/
//! country — **grid and state are subscriber-only**. So `grid`/`state` are
//! `Option` and routinely `None` for non-subscribers (the expected case).
