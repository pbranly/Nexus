//! Silent match-failure diagnostics — "why isn't this QSO confirmed, and what's
//! the one fix?". The differentiator incumbents don't ship: incumbents surface
//! "no matching QSO" errors for *manual* fixing; this turns the data we already
//! have (the reconcile `OrphanConfirmation` list, the source-aware
//! `confirmed`/`award_confirmed` split, the per-QSO credit fields) into a ranked,
//! actionable per-QSO explanation.
//!
//! Pure (no network, no clock — `now` is a parameter), like [`crate::reconcile`].
//!
//! Covers: confirmed-on-a-non-award-source (R3), field-mismatch via orphans
//! (R4a/b/c), WAS-blocking missing STATE (R4d, US-family-gated), busted call
//! (R6), possible duplicate (R7), and the upload-state reasons (R1
//! never-uploaded, R9 bounced, the Confident R2 partner-hasn't) via the
//! `UploadState` field (the spec's Phase 1b — shipped).
