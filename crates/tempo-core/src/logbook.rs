//! Persistent QSO logbook (ADIF).
//!
//! Records completed contacts across sessions (so they survive restart, unlike
//! the live roster) and answers "worked before?" for dupe / B4 highlighting.
//! Stored as an ADIF file the operator can import into any logger. This is the
//! general logbook for Chat/QSO contacts — Field Day keeps its own contest log
//! ([`crate::fieldday`]).
//!
//! # The log is the one thing here that cannot be regenerated
//!
//! Two safety copies, and they answer different questions:
//!
//! - **The anchor** — `log.adi.bak`, beside the log, written by [`Logbook::backup_once`] the
//!   first time a non-empty log is loaded, owner-only, and touched again exactly once and only
//!   if it holds an upload stamp a pre-1.11 build wrote (see [`scrub_upload_stamps`]). It
//!   answers "what did this log look like before this build ever wrote to it", which is the
//!   only question that helps when the PARSER is what lost the records. It is never rotated
//!   and never deleted.
//! - **The ring** — dated snapshots in a `backups/` folder beside the log, taken on the SAVE
//!   path by [`Logbook::snapshot_before_save`]. It answers "what did the log look like last
//!   week", and it is bounded three ways so it cannot grow without limit.
//!
//! **The snapshot trigger is SAVE, never LOAD, and that is deliberate.** [`Logbook::save`]
//! already rewrites the whole file, so one extra copy costs one more pass over a file the OS
//! is touching anyway — and launch pays nothing. Snapshotting at load time would put a
//! whole-file copy of a multi-MB log on the startup path, which is exactly what the operator
//! ruled out (2026-08: "a big log must not make launch slow"). `load` writes at most the
//! one-time anchor and, after that, nothing at all.
//!
//! **The one exception, and it happens once per install.** A `log.adi` written up to 1.10.x can
//! carry a service's own refusal text — an API key among it — in an `APP_TEMPO_UL_*` tail. The
//! parse-time filter in [`take_upload`] keeps that out of every EXPORT and leaves the bytes
//! where they are, and `load` copies those bytes into the anchor BEFORE the parser runs, so the
//! key ends up in a second file that is never rewritten. So the clean runs on the bytes at
//! load, ahead of the copy, over the anchor and the ring as well
//! ([`Logbook::sweep_backups_if_changed`]), and the log itself is rewritten once
//! ([`Logbook::scrub_log_in_place`]). The copy sweep is NOT gated on the log being poisoned — a
//! copy can be poisoned while the log is already clean (an upgrade that cleaned `log.adi` on a save
//! but never swept the copies), and it can also ARRIVE poisoned later (a backup restore, a profile
//! sync, a laptop migration), so the sweep must not be one-shot. It is gated instead on "has any
//! copy changed since I last swept it", answered by `stat` (size + mtime) against a small
//! `.scrubbed` manifest — so the ordinary launch reads only that tiny file and the copies' metadata,
//! never their multi-MB contents (the 2026-08 "a big log must not make launch slow" ruling), while
//! anything new, restored, or synced in is simply not the signature we recorded and IS swept. A
//! stale, empty, foreign, or absent manifest reads as "nothing recorded", so it cannot suppress a
//! sweep — it can only cause one (the safe direction).
//!
//! **Why the snapshot is a COPY and not a hard link.** A link would be free, but
//! [`Logbook::append`] opens the log with `.append(true)` and mutates it **in place** — a
//! hard link is the same inode, so it would follow every later append instead of freezing
//! the bytes, and the "snapshot" would silently be a second name for the live file. Do not
//! "optimise" the copy into a link.

/// launch.
///
/// # ⛔ Why this exists ON TOP of the parse-time filter in [`take_upload`]
///
/// That filter cleans what an EXPORT can quote, and nothing else. The bytes stay on disk —
/// and [`Logbook::load`] copies them into the anchor `.bak` before the parser ever runs, so
/// a machine that ran an affected 1.x build has the key in a second file that is never
/// overwritten and never cleaned, plus one copy per snapshot in `backups/`. Cleaning has to
/// happen on the BYTES, upstream of the copy, or it only fixes the file that was going to be
/// rewritten anyway.
///
/// # Why it is a byte rewrite and not a parse-and-re-emit
///
/// Re-emitting from [`parse_adif`] would push the operator's whole log through the very
/// parser whose lossiness the anchor exists to insure against — a scrub that silently drops
/// a record it could not assemble would be a far worse bug than the one it fixes. So this is
/// a copier with one exception: the tail of a stamp no build of this file could have written.
/// Everything else, including a record the parser would refuse and a field in CP1253, is
/// passed through untouched.
///
/// # A well-formed length is trusted; a corrupt one is resynced, never trusted-and-copied
///
/// The scan walks `<NAME:len>value` sequentially and skips each value by its own length, so a
/// stamp-shaped tag QUOTED inside another field's value is data and is left alone. A length that
/// over-runs the whole file (or overflows) is unambiguous corruption — its declared count cannot be
/// believed. It is NOT stopped-at-and-copied-verbatim, because that routes a poisoned stamp AFTER
/// the corruption straight past the scrub and into a fresh anchor (round 7 F5); instead the scan
/// resyncs at the next `<` and keeps going, exactly as [`parse_adif`] does. `<` cannot occur inside
/// a UTF-8 multibyte sequence, and only a corrupt file can over-run the file length, so no
/// well-formed field is ever skipped by the resync.
