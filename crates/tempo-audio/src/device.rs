//! Real sound-card audio via `cpal` (feature `device`).
//!
//! Opens the default input and output devices, downmixes input to mono, fans
//! mono output to all channels, and resamples between the device's native rate
//! and the modem's 12 kHz. The RX/decode path uses a stateful, anti-aliased
//! decimator ([`crate::capture_resample::CaptureResampler`]); TX playback keeps
//! the plain linear resample (upsampling has no aliasing hazard). The cpal
//! callbacks (which run on an audio thread)
//! exchange device-rate samples with this struct through WAIT-FREE rings
//! ([`SpscRing`]);
//! [`AudioBackend::capture`]/[`AudioBackend::play`] do the resampling on the
//! caller's thread.
//!
//! ⚠️ **NO CALLBACK MAY EVER BLOCK ON THE RADIO LOOP** (#172, KR8MER). Both decode-path rings
//! used to be `Mutex<VecDeque<f32>>`, and the producer held the TX one across
//! `ring.extend(dev)` — a whole upsampled FT over, ~630k f32, with the `VecDeque` reallocation
//! inside the critical section — while the realtime output callback locked the same mutex every
//! buffer. That is textbook priority inversion: when Windows parks cores on battery the copy
//! outruns the callback deadline and the callback emits silence, which is the gated TX the
//! reporter heard (and why it was dramatically worse on battery, why raising process priority
//! helped, and why WSJT-X on identical hardware is clean). Both rings are now the same
//! atomics-only [`SpscRing`] the headphone monitor has always used, the RX meter is a plain
//! atomic, and what the rings drop is COUNTED ([`audio_health`]) rather than asserted away.
//!
//! Device/rate selection here is the conservative default; on a real station you
//! may want to pick a specific CODEC device and a 48 kHz config explicitly.
