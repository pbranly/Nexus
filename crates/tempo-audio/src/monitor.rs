//! Headphone monitor: a live pass-through of the RX audio the decoder hears to a
//! chosen output device, so the operator can HEAR the band and diagnose levels /
//! RFI. Ships DARK — off by default; a later attended session at the rig verifies
//! latency and levels.
//!
//! The load-bearing invariant is that **the decode path must never degrade**. The
//! capture callback (which feeds the decoder) and the monitor output callback each
//! run on their own real-time audio thread. A mutex shared between them could block
//! the capture thread. So monitoring uses a wait-free single-producer /
//! single-consumer ring ([`SpscRing`]) built from atomics only: the capture thread
//! `push`es and NEVER blocks or allocates, dropping samples on overflow (a monitor
//! glitch) — the decoder is never stalled by monitoring.
//!
//! The pure pieces (the ring, the TX-device guard, the resampler) compile without
//! the `device` feature so they are unit-testable in the headless workspace build;
//! the cpal output stream lives behind `#[cfg(feature = "device")]`.
